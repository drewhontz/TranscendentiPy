                        There is health in thy gray wing,Health of nature’s furnishing.Say, thou modern-winged antique,Was thy mistress ever sick?In each heaving of thy wingThou dost health and leisure bring,Thou dost waive disease and painAnd resume new life again.                                                 Among the signs of autumn I perceiveThe Roman wormwood (called by learned menAmbrosia elatior, food for gods,—For to impartial science the humblest weedIs as immortal once as the proudest flower—)Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoesAs I cross the now neglected garden.—We trample under foot the food of godsAnd spill their nectar in each dropp of dew—My honest shoes, fast friends that never strayFar from my couch, thus powdered, countryfied,Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure,At the post-house disgrace the Gallic glossOf those well dressed ones who no morning dewNor Roman wormwood ever have been through,Who never walk but are transported rather—For what old crime of theirs I do not gather.                                                 Within the circuit of this plodding lifeThere enter moments of an azure hue,Untarnished fair as is the violetOr anemone, when the spring strews themBy some meandering rivulet, which makeThe best philosophy untrue that aimsBut to console man for his grievancesI have remembered when the winter came,High in my chamber in the frosty nights,When in the still light of the cheerful moon,On every twig and rail and jutting spout,The icy spears were adding to their lengthAgainst the arrows of the coming sun,How in the shimmering noon of summer pastSome unrecorded beam slanted acrossThe upland pastures where the Johnswort grew;Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flagLoitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,Which now through all its course stands still and dumbIts own memorial,—purling at its playAlong the slopes, and through the meadows next,Until its youthful sound was hushed at lastIn the staid current of the lowland stream;Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,When all the fields around lay bound and hoarBeneath a thick integument of snow.So by God's cheap economy made richTo go upon my winter's task again.                                                 Away! away! away! away! Ye have not kept your secret well, I will abide that other day, Those other lands ye tell.Has time no leisure left for these, The acts that ye rehearse? Is not eternity a lease For better deeds than verse?‘Tis sweet to hear of heroes dead, To know them still alive, But sweeter if we earn their bread, And in us they survive.Our life should feed the springs of fame With a perennial wave, As ocean feeds the babbling founts Which find it in their grave.Ye skies dropp gently round my breast, And be my corselet blue, Ye earth receive my lance in rest, My faithful charger you;Ye stars my spear-heads in the sky, My arrow-tips ye are; I see the routed foemen fly, My bright spears fixed are.Give me an angel for a foe, Fix now the place and time, And straight to meet him I will go Above the starry chime.And with our clashing bucklers’ clang The heavenly spears shall ring, While bright the northern lights shall hang Beside our tourneying.And if she lose her champion true, Tell Heaven not despair, For I will be her champion new, Her fame I will repair.                                                 Lately alas I knew a gentle boy, Whose features all were cast in Virtue's mould, As one she had designed for Beauty's toy, But after manned him for her own strong-hold.On every side he open was as day, That you might see no lack of strength within, For walls and ports do only serve alway For a pretence to feebleness and sin.Say not that Cćsar was victorious, With toil and strife who stormed the House of Fame; In other sense this youth was glorious, Himself a kingdom wheresoe'er he came.No strength went out to get him victory, When all was income of its own accord; For where he went none other was to see, But all were parcel of their noble lord.He forayed like the subtle breeze of summer, That stilly shows fresh landscapes to the eyes, And revolutions worked without a murmur, Or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies.So was I taken unawares by this, I quite forgot my homage to confess; Yet now am forced to know, though hard it is, I might have loved him, had I loved him less.Each moment, as we nearer drew to each, A stern respect withheld us farther yet, So that we seemed beyond each other's reach, And less acquainted than when first we met.We two were one while we did sympathize, So could we not the simplest bargain drive; And what avails it now that we are wise, If absence doth this doubleness contrive?Eternity may not the chance repeat, But I must tread my single way alone, In sad remembrance that we once did meet, And know that bliss irrevocably gone.The spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing, For elegy has other subject none; Each strain of music in my ears shall ring Knell of departure from that other one.Make haste and celebrate my tragedy; With fitting strain resound ye woods and fields; Sorrow is dearer in such case to me Than all the joys other occasion yields.Is't then too late the damage to repair? Distance, forsooth, from my weak grasp hath reft The empty husk, and clutched the useless tare, But in my hands the wheat and kernel left.If I but love that virtue which he is, Though it be scented in the morning air, Still shall we be truest acquaintances, Nor mortals know a sympathy more rare.                                                 THOUGH all the fates should prove unkind,Leave not your native land behind.The ship, becalmed, at length stands still;The steed must rest beneath the hill;But swiftly still our fortunes paceTo find us out in every place.The vessel, though her masts be firm,Beneath her copper bears a worm;Around the cape, across the line,Till fields of ice her course confine;It matters not how smooth the breeze,How shallow or how deep the seas,Whether she bears Manilla twine,Or in her hold Madeira wine,Or China teas, or Spanish hides,In port or quarantine she rides;Far from New England's blustering shore,New England's worm her hulk shall bore,And sink her in the Indian seas,Twine, wine, and hides, and China teas.                                                 MY life is like a stroll upon the beach,As near the ocean’s edge as I can go;My tardy steps its waves sometimes o’erreach,Sometimes I stay to let them overflow.My sole employment is, and scrupulous care, To place my gains beyond the reach of tides,—Each smoother pebble, and each shell more rare,Which Ocean kindly to my hand confides.I have but few companions on the shore:They scorn the strand who sail upon the sea; Yet oft I think the ocean they’ve sailed o’erIs deeper known upon the strand to me.The middle sea contains no crimson dulse,Its deeper waves cast up no pearls to view;Along the shore my hand is on its pulse, And I converse with many a shipwrecked crew.                                                 IN vain I see the morning rise,In vain observe the western blaze,Who idly look to other skies,Expecting life by other ways.Amidst such boundless wealth without,I only still am poor within,The birds have sung their summer out,But still my spring does not begin.Shall I then wait the autumn wind,Compelled to seek a milder day,And leave no curious nest behind,No woods still echoing to my lay?                                                 Great God, I ask for no meaner pelfThan that I may not disappoint myself,That in my action I may soar as highAs I can now discern with this clear eye.And next in value, which thy kindness lends, That I may greatly disappoint my friends,Howe'er they think or hope that it may be,They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me.That my weak hand may equal my firm faithAnd my life practice what my tongue saithThat my low conduct may not showNor my relenting linesThat I thy purpose did not knowOr overrated thy designs.                                                 SALMON Brook,Penichook,Ye sweet waters of my brain,When shall I look,Or cast the hook,In your waves again?Silver eels,Wooden creels,These the baits that still allure,And dragon-flyThat floated by,May they still endure?                                                 They who prepare my evening meal below Carelessly hit the kettle as they go With tongs or shovel, And ringing round and round, Out of this hovel It makes an eastern temple by the sound. At first I thought a cow bell right at hand Mid birches sounded o'er the open land, Where I plucked flowers Many years ago, Spending midsummer hours With such secure delight they hardly seemed to flow.                                                 I was made erect and lone,And within me is the bone;Still my vision will be clear,Still my life will not be drear,To the center all is near.Where I sit there is my throne.If age choose to sit apart,If age choose, give me the start,Take the sap and leave the heart.                                                 What's the railroad to me?I never go to seeWhere it ends.It fills a few hollows,And makes banks for the swallows,It sets the sand a-blowing,And the blackberries a-growing.                                                 LIGHT-WINGED Smoke, Icarian bird,Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,Lark without song, and the messenger of dawn,Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;Or else, departing dream, and shadowy formOf midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;By night star-veiling, and by dayDarkening the light and blotting out the sun;Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.                                                 Packed in my mind lie all the clothes Which outward nature wears, And in its fashion's hourly change It all things else repairs. In vain I look for change abroad, And can no difference find, Till some new ray of peace uncalled Illumes my inmost mind. What is it gilds the trees and clouds, And paints the heavens so gay, But yonder fast-abiding light With its unchanging ray? Lo, when the sun streams through the wood, Upon a winter's morn, Where'er his silent beams intrude, The murky night is gone. How could the patient pine have known The morning breeze would come, Or humble flowers anticipate The insect's noonday hum-- Till the new light with morning cheer From far streamed through the aisles, And nimbly told the forest trees For many stretching miles? I've heard within my inmost soul Such cheerful morning news, In the horizon of my mind Have seen such orient hues, As in the twilight of the dawn, When the first birds awake, Are heard within some silent wood, Where they the small twigs break, Or in the eastern skies are seen, Before the sun appears, The harbingers of summer heats Which from afar he bears.                                                 I am a parcel of vain strivings tied By a chance bond together, Dangling this way and that, their links Were made so loose and wide, Methinks, For milder weather. A bunch of violets without their roots, And sorrel intermixed, Encircled by a wisp of straw Once coiled about their shoots, The law By which I'm fixed. A nosegay which Time clutched from out Those fair Elysian fields, With weeds and broken stems, in haste, Doth make the rabble rout That waste The day he yields. And here I bloom for a short hour unseen, Drinking my juices up, With no root in the land To keep my branches green, But stand In a bare cup. Some tender buds were left upon my stem In mimicry of life, But ah! the children will not know, Till time has withered them, The woe With which they're rife. But now I see I was not plucked for naught, And after in life's vase Of glass set while I might survive, But by a kind hand brought Alive To a strange place. That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours, And by another year, Such as God knows, with freer air, More fruits and fairer flowers Will bear, While I droop here.                                                 SendingIn delinquencyTo disappointThe amber of waterAt a high soul                                                 Mine are the night and morning,The pits of air, the gull of space,The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,The innumerable days.I hide in the solar glory,I am dumb in the pealing song,I rest on the pitch of the torrent,In slumber I am strong.No numbers have counted my tallies,No tribes my house can fill,I sit by the shining Fount of LifeAnd pour the deluge still;And ever by delicate powersGathering along the centuriesFrom race on race the rarest flowers,My wreath shall nothing miss.And many a thousand summersMy gardens ripened well,And light from meliorating starsWith firmer glory fell.I wrote the past in charactersOf rock and fire the scroll,The building in the coral sea,The planting of the coal.And thefts from satellites and ringsAnd broken stars I drew,And out of spent and aged thingsI formed the world anew;What time the gods kept carnival,Tricked out in star and flower,And in cramp elf and saurian formsThey swathed their too much power.Time and Thought were my surveyors,They laid their courses well,They boiled the sea, and piled the layersOf granite, marl and shell.But he, the man-child glorious, -Where tarries he the while?The rainbow shines his harbinger,The sunset gleams his smile.My boreal lights leap upward,Forthright my planets roll,And still the man-child is not born,The summit of the whole.Must time and tide forever run?Will never my winds go sleep in the west?Will never my wheels which whirl the sunAnd satellites have rest?Too much of donning and doffing,Too slow the rainbow fades,I weary of my robe of snow,My leaves and my cascades;I tire of globes and races,Too long the game is played;What without him is summer's pomp,Or winter's frozen shade?I travail in pain for him,My creatures travail and wait;His couriers come by squadrons,He comes not to the gate.Twice I have moulded an image,And thrice outstretched my hand,Made one of day and one of nightAnd one of the salt sea-sand.One in a Judaean manger,And one by Avon stream,One over against the mouths of Nile,And one in the Academe.I moulded kings and saviors,And bards o'er kings to rule; -But fell the starry influence short,The cup was never full.Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,And mix the bowl again;Seethe, Fate! the ancient elements,Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.Let war and trade and creeds and songBlend, ripen race on race,The sunburnt world a man shall breedOf all the zones and countless days.No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,My oldest force is good as new,And the fresh rose on yonder thornGives back the bending heavens in dew.                                                 Men say they know many things;But lo! they have taken wings, —The arts and sciences,And a thousand appliances;The wind that blowsIs all that any body knows.                                                 ALL things are current foundOn earthly ground,Spirits and elementsHave their descents.Night and day, year on year,High and low, far and near,These are our own aspects,These are our own regrets.Ye gods of the shore,Who abide evermore,I see you far headland,Stretching on either hand;I hear the sweet evening soundsFrom your undecaying grounds;Cheat me no more with time,Take me to your clime.                                                 I am a parcel of vain strivings tiedBy a chance bond together,Dangling this way and that, their linksWere made so loose and wide,Methinks,For milder weather.A bunch of violets without their roots,And sorrel intermixed,Encircled by a wisp of strawOnce coiled about their shoots,The lawBy which I'm fixed.A nosegay which Time clutched from outThose fair Elysian fields,With weeds and broken stems, in haste,Doth make the rabble routThat wasteThe day he yields.And here I bloom for a short hour unseen,Drinking my juices up,With no root in the landTo keep my branches green,But standIn a bare cup.Some tender buds were left upon my stemIn mimicry of life,But ah! the children will not know,Till time has withered them,The woeWith which they're rife.But now I see I was not plucked for naught,And after in life's vaseOf glass set while I might survive,But by a kind hand broughtAliveTo a strange place.That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,And by another year,Such as God knows, with freer air,More fruits and fairer flowersWill bear,While I droop here.                                                 On fields o'er which the reaper's hand has pass'd Lit by the harvest moon and autumn sun, My thoughts like stubble floating in the wind And of such fineness as October airs, There after harvest could I glean my life A richer harvest reaping without toil, And weaving gorgeous fancies at my will In subtler webs than finest summer haze.                                                 Let such pure hate still underprop Our love, that we may be Each other's conscience, And have our sympathy Mainly from thence. We'll one another treat like gods, And all the faith we have In virtue and in truth, bestow On either, and suspicion leave To gods below. Two solitary stars-- Unmeasured systems far Between us roll; But by our conscious light we are Determined to one pole. What need confound the sphere?-- Love can afford to wait; For it no hour's too late That witnesseth one duty's end, Or to another doth beginning lend. It will subserve no use, More than the tints of flowers; Only the independent guest Frequents its bowers, Inherits its bequest. No speech, though kind, has it; But kinder silence doles Unto its mates; By night consoles, By day congratulates. What saith the tongue to tongue? What hearest ear of ear? By the decrees of fate From year to year, Does it communicate. Pathless the gulf of feeling yawns; No trivial bridge of words, Or arch of boldest span, Can leap the moat that girds The sincere man. No show of bolts and bars Can keep the foeman out, Or 'scape his secret mine, Who entered with the doubt That drew the line. No warder at the gate Can let the friendly in; But, like the sun, o'er all He will the castle win, And shine along the wall. There's nothing in the world I know That can escape from love, For every depth it goes below, And every height above. It waits, as waits the sky, Until the clouds go by, Yet shines serenely on With an eternal day, Alike when they are gone, And when they stay. Implacable is Love-- Foes may be bought or teased From their hostile intent, But he goes unappeased Who is on kindness bent.                                                 Low-anchored cloud, Newfoundland air, Fountain-head and source of rivers, Dew-cloth, dream-drapery, And napkin spread by fays; Drifting meadow of the air, Where bloom the daisied banks and violets, And in whose fenny labyrinth The bittern booms and heron wades; Spirit of lakes and seas and rivers, Bear only perfumes and the scent Of healing herbs to just men's fields!                                                 Pray to what earth does this sweet cold belong, Which asks no duties and no conscience? The moon goes up by leaps, her cheerful path In some far summer stratum of the sky, While stars with their cold shine bedot her way. The fields gleam mildly back upon the sky, And far and near upon the leafless shrubs The snow dust still emits a silver light. Under the hedge, where drift banks are their screen, The titmice now pursue their downy dreams, As often in the sweltering summer nights The bee doth drop asleep in the flower cup, When evening overtakes him with his load. By the brooksides, in the still, genial night, The more adventurous wanderer may hear The crystals shoot and form, and winter slow Increase his rule by gentlest summer means.                                                 There is a vale which none hath seen, Where foot of man has never been, Such as here lives with toil and strife, An anxious and a sinful life. There every virtue has its birth, Ere it descends upon the earth, And thither every deed returns, Which in the generous bosom burns. There love is warm, and youth is young, And poetry is yet unsung. For Virtue still adventures there, And freely breathes her native air. And ever, if you hearken well, You still may hear its vesper bell, And tread of high-souled men go by, Their thoughts conversing with the sky.                                                 Great God, I ask for no meaner pelf Than that I may not disappoint myself, That in my action I may soar as high As I can now discern with this clear eye. And next in value, which thy kindness lends, That I may greatly disappoint my friends, Howe'er they think or hope that it may be, They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me. That my weak hand may equal my firm faith And my life practice what my tongue saith That my low conduct may not show Nor my relenting lines That I thy purpose did not know Or overrated thy designs.                                                 O Nature! I do not aspireTo be the highest in thy choir, -To be a meteor in thy sky,Or comet that may range on high;Only a zephyr that may blowAmong the reeds by the river low;Give me thy most privy placeWhere to run my airy race.In some withdrawn, unpublic meadLet me sigh upon a reed,Or in the woods, with leafy din,Whisper the still evening in:Some still work give me to do, -Only - be it near to you!For I'd rather be thy childAnd pupil, in the forest wild,Than be the king of men elsewhere,And most sovereign slave of care;To have one moment of thy dawn,Than share the city's year forlorn.                                                 Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird, Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight, Lark without song, and messenger of dawn Circling above the hamlets as they nest; Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts; By night star-veiling, and by day Darkening the light and blotting out the sun; Go thou my incense upward from this hearth, And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.                                                 Here lies the body of this world, Whose soul alas to hell is hurled. This golden youth long since was past, Its silver manhood went as fast, An iron age drew on at last; 'Tis vain its character to tell, The several fates which it befell, What year it died, when 'twill arise, We only know that here it lies.                                                 My life has been the poemI would have writ, But I could not both liveand utter it.                                                 Sometimes a mortal feels in himself Nature -- not his Father but his Mother stirs within him, and he becomes immortal with herimmortality. From time to time she claims kindredship with us, and some globule from her veins steals up into our own.I am the autumnal sun,With autumn gales my race is run;When will the hazel put forth its flowers,Or the grape ripen under my bowers?When will the harvest or the hunter's moonTurn my midnight into mid-noon?I am all sere and yellow,And to my core mellow.The mast is dropping within my woods,The winter is lurking within my moods,And the rustling of the withered leafIs the constant music of my grief...                                                 I knew a man by sight, A blameless wight, Who, for a year or more, Had daily passed my door, Yet converse none had had with him. I met him in a lane, Him and his cane, About three miles from home, Where I had chanced to roam, And volumes stared at him, and he at me. In a more distant place I glimpsed his face, And bowed instinctively; Starting he bowed to me, Bowed simultaneously, and passed along. Next, in a foreign land I grasped his hand, And had a social chat, About this thing and that, As I had known him well a thousand years. Late in a wilderness I shared his mess, For he had hardships seen, And I a wanderer been; He was my bosom friend, and I was his. And as, methinks, shall all, Both great and small, That ever lived on earth, Early or late their birth, Stranger and foe, one day each other know.                                                 Within the circuit of this plodding life There enter moments of an azure hue, Untarnished fair as is the violet Or anemone, when the spring stew them By some meandering rivulet, which make The best philosophy untrue that aims But to console man for his grievences. I have remembered when the winter came, High in my chamber in the frosty nights, When in the still light of the cheerful moon, On the every twig and rail and jutting spout, The icy spears were adding to their length Against the arrows of the coming sun, How in the shimmering noon of winter past Some unrecorded beam slanted across The upland pastures where the Johnwort grew; Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, Which now through all its course stands still and dumb Its own memorial, - purling at its play Along the slopes, and through the meadows next, Until its youthful sound was hushed at last In the staid current of the lowland stream; Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned, And where the fieldfare followed in the rear, When all the fields around lay bound and hoar Beneath a thick integument of snow. So by God's cheap economy made rich To go upon my winter's task again.                                                 Low-anchored cloud, Newfoundland air, Fountain head and source of rivers, Dew-cloth, dream drapery, And napkin spread by fays; Drifting meadow of the air, Where bloom the dasied banks and violets, And in whose fenny labyrinth The bittern booms and heron wades; Spirit of the lake and seas and rivers, Bear only purfumes and the scent Of healing herbs to just men's fields!                                                 My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read, 'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large Down in the meadow, where is richer feed, And will not mind to hit their proper targe. Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too, Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again, What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true, Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men. Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough, What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town, If juster battles are enacted now Between the ants upon this hummock's crown? Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn, If red or black the gods will favor most, Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn, Struggling to heave some rock against the host. Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour, For now I've business with this drop of dew, And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower-- I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue. This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use. A clover tuft is pillow for my head, And violets quite overtop my shoes. And now the cordial clouds have shut all in, And gently swells the wind to say all's well; The scattered drops are falling fast and thin, Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell. I am well drenched upon my bed of oats; But see that globe come rolling down its stem, Now like a lonely planet there it floats, And now it sinks into my garment's hem. Drip drip the trees for all the country round, And richness rare distills from every bough; The wind alone it is makes every sound, Shaking down crystals on the leaves below. For shame the sun will never show himself, Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so; My dripping locks--they would become an elf, Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.                                                 Whate'er we leave to God, God does, And blesses us; The work we choose should be our own, God leaves alone. If with light head erect I sing, Though all the Muses lend their force, From my poor love of anything, The verse is weak and shallow as its source. But if with bended neck I grope Listening behind me for my wit, With faith superior to hope, More anxious to keep back than forward it; Making my soul accomplice there Unto the flame my heart hath lit, Then will the verse forever wear-- Time cannot bend the line which God hath writ. Always the general show of things Floats in review before my mind, And such true love and reverence brings, That sometimes I forget that I am blind. But now there comes unsought, unseen, Some clear divine electuary, And I, who had but sensual been, Grow sensible, and as God is, am wary. I hearing get, who had but ears, And sight, who had but eyes before, I moments live, who lived but years, And truth discern, who knew but learning's lore. I hear beyond the range of sound, I see beyond the range of sight, New earths and skies and seas around, And in my day the sun doth pale his light. A clear and ancient harmony Pierces my soul through all its din, As through its utmost melody-- Farther behind than they, farther within. More swift its bolt than lightning is, Its voice than thunder is more loud, It doth expand my privacies To all, and leave me single in the crowd. It speaks with such authority, With so serene and lofty tone, That idle Time runs gadding by, And leaves me with Eternity alone. Now chiefly is my natal hour, And only now my prime of life; Of manhood's strength it is the flower, 'Tis peace's end and war's beginning strife. It comes in summer's broadest noon, By a grey wall or some chance place, Unseasoning Time, insulting June, And vexing day with its presuming face. Such fragrance round my couch it makes, More rich than are Arabian drugs, That my soul scents its life and wakes The body up beneath its perfumed rugs. Such is the Muse, the heavenly maid, The star that guides our mortal course, Which shows where life's true kernel's laid, Its wheat's fine flour, and its undying force. She with one breath attunes the spheres, And also my poor human heart, With one impulse propels the years Around, and gives my throbbing pulse its start. I will not doubt for evermore, Nor falter from a steadfast faith, For thought the system be turned o'er, God takes not back the word which once He saith. I will not doubt the love untold Which not my worth nor want has bought, Which wooed me young, and woos me old, And to this evening hath me brought. My memory I'll educate To know the one historic truth, Remembering to the latest date The only true and sole immortal youth. Be but thy inspiration given, No matter through what danger sought, I'll fathom hell or climb to heaven, And yet esteem that cheap which love has bought. ___________________ Fame cannot tempt the bard Who's famous with his God, Nor laurel him reward Who has his Maker's nod.                                                 Conscience is instinct bred in the house, Feeling and Thinking propagate the sin By an unnatural breeding in and in. I say, Turn it out doors, Into the moors. I love a life whose plot is simple, And does not thicken with every pimple, A soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it, That makes the universe no worse than 't finds it. I love an earnest soul, Whose mighty joy and sorrow Are not drowned in a bowl, And brought to life to-morrow; That lives one tragedy, And not seventy; A conscience worth keeping; Laughing not weeping; A conscience wise and steady, And forever ready; Not changing with events, Dealing in compliments; A conscience exercised about Large things, where one may doubt. I love a soul not all of wood, Predestinated to be good, But true to the backbone Unto itself alone, And false to none; Born to its own affairs, Its own joys and own cares; By whom the work which God begun Is finished, and not undone; Taken up where he left off, Whether to worship or to scoff; If not good, why then evil, If not good god, good devil. Goodness! you hypocrite, come out of that, Live your life, do your work, then take your hat. I have no patience towards Such conscientious cowards. Give me simple laboring folk, Who love their work, Whose virtue is song To cheer God along.                                                 Indeed indeed, I cannot tell, Though I ponder on it well, Which were easier to state, All my love or all my hate. Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me When I say thou dost disgust me. O, I hate thee with a hate That would fain annihilate; Yet sometimes against my will, My dear friend, I love thee still. It were treason to our love, And a sin to God above, One iota to abate Of a pure impartial hate.                                                 Time wears her not; she doth his chariot guide; Mortality below her orb is placed. --Raleigh The full-orbed moon with unchanged ray Mounts up the eastern sky, Not doomed to these short nights for aye, But shining steadily. She does not wane, but my fortune, Which her rays do not bless, My wayward path declineth soon, But she shines not the less. And if she faintly glimmers here, And paled is her light, Yet alway in her proper sphere She's mistress of the night.                                                 I think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. ______ Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably.                                                 Trippers and askers surround me,People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;These come to me days and nights and go from me again,But they are not the Me myself.Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.                                                 Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,For me those that have been boys and that love women,For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,For me children and the begetters of children.Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.                                                 The little one sleeps in its cradle,I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,I peeringly view them from the top.The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or in fits,What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain'd by decorum,Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.                                                 The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.                                                 The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanks- giving dinner,The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye,The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's bed-room;)The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manu- script;The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,What is removed drops horribly in a pail;The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove,The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle,The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their part- ners, the dancers bow to each other,The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to the musical rain,The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale,The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways,As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers,The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child,The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter's         lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser hig- gling about the odd cent;)The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd,         it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through         those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grand- sons around them,In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day's sport,The city sleeps and the country sleeps,The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.                                                 I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff that is fine,One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the         limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tack- ing,At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (lov- ing their big proportions,)Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.I resist any thing better than my own diversity,Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,And am not stuck up, and am in my place.(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)                                                 These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,This the common air that bathes the globe.                                                 Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,Else it were time lost listening to me.I do not snivel that snivel the world over,That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, con- formity goes to the fourth-remov'd,I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with doctors and calculated close,I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.I know I am solid and sound,To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.I know I am deathless,I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.I know I am august,I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,I see that the elementary laws never apologize,(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)I exist as I am, that is enough,If no other in the world be aware I sit content,And if each and all be aware I sit content.One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is my- self,And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,I laugh at what you call dissolution,And I know the amplitude of time.                                                 Now I will do nothing but listen,To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streak-         ing engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd lights,The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and two,(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd them,It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent waves,I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,And that we call Being.                                                 To be in any form, what is that?(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.Mine is no callous shell,I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.                                                 Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture- fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.The sentries desert every other part of me,They have left me helpless to a red marauder,They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.I am given up by traitors,I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.                                                 Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch!Did it make you ache so, leaving me?Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.                                                 All truths wait in all things,They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,The insignificant is as big to me as any,(What is less or more than a touch?)Logic and sermons never convince,The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,Only what nobody denies is so.)A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.                                                 I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,But call any thing back again when I desire it.In vain the speeding or shyness,In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.                                                 I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain'd,I stand and look at them long and long.They do not sweat and whine about their condition,They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.So they show their relations to me and I accept them,They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.I wonder where they get those tokens,Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?Myself moving forward then and now and forever,Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.                                                 Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning.My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,I am afoot with my vision.By the city's quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver patsthe mud with his paddle-shaped tail;Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and slender shoots from the gutters,Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold- bug drops through the dark,Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shud- dering of their hides,Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons         straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it my- self and looking composedly down,)Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupt- ing below;Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long- lived swan is curving and winding,Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the office or public hall;Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with the new and old,Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preach- er, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the moccasin print,By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,I tread day and night such roads.I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,My course runs below the soundings of plummets.I help myself to material and immaterial,No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.I anchor my ship for a little while only,My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike- pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.I ascend to the foretruck,I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.I understand the large hearts of heroes,The courage of present times and all times,How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faith ful of days and faithful of nights,And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will          not desert you;How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and would not give it up,How he saved the drifting company at last,How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the side of their prepared graves,How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp- lipp'd unshaved men;All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.The disdain and calmness of martyrs,The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blow- ing, cover'd with sweat,The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the mur- derous buckshot and the bullets,All these I feel or am.I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marks- men,I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the ooze of my skin,I fall on the weeds and stones,The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.Agonies are one of my changes of garments,I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my com- rades,I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.Distant and dead resuscitate,They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,I am there again.Again the long roll of the drummers,Again the attacking cannon, mortars,Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.I take part, I see and hear the whole,The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explo- sion,The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,He gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrench-          ments.                                                 A call in the midst of the crowd,My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.Come my children,Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude on the reeds within.Easily written loose-finger'd chords—I feel the thrum of your climax and close.My head slues round on my neck,Music rolls, but not from the organ,Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.Ever the hard unsunk ground,Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts,Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth,Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going.Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.This is the city and I am one of the citizens,Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools,The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd coats,I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,What I do and say the same waits for them,Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.I know perfectly well my own egotism,Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.Not words of routine this song of mine,But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;This printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing- office boy?The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets— but the pluck of the captain and engineers?In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?                                                 I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical,I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.How the flukes splash!How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,I take my place among you as much as among any,The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.I do not know what is untried and afterward,But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd, not a single one can it fail.It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again,Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad dis- order,Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.                                                 It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.What is known I strip away,I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.Births have brought us richness and variety,And other births will bring us richness and variety.I do not call one greater and one smaller,That which fills its period and place is equal to any.Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,(What have I to do with lamentation?)I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things to be.My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.Immense have been the preparations for me,Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.For it the nebula cohered to an orb,The long slow strata piled to rest it on,Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.                                                 O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!O manhood, balanced, florid and full.My lovers suffocate me,Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,Lighting on every moment of my life,Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself,And the dark hush promulges as much as any.I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,Outward and outward and forever outward.My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,         were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,We should surely bring up again where we now stand,And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,They are but parts, any thing is but a part.See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.                                                 I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,My left hand hooking you round the waist,My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,You must travel it for yourself.It is not far, it is within reach,Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,For after we start we never lie by again.This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded heaven,And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those          orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in          them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue          beyond.You are also asking me questions and I hear you,I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.Sit a while dear son,Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I         kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,Now I wash the gum from your eyes,You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.                                                 I am the teacher of athletes,He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right,Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers,And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,My words itch at your ears till you understand them.I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat,(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key,The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,But roughs and little children better than they.The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his blanket,The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,The young mother and old mother comprehend me,The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,They and all would resume what I have told them.                                                 I have said that the soul is not more than the body,And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.Why should I wish to see God better than this day?I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's name,And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,Others will punctually come for ever and ever.                                                 And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of melons.And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and pro- motions,If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,Toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.                                                 There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,I sleep—I sleep long.I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.Do you see O my brothers and sisters?It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.                                                 The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)Do I contradict myself?Very well then I contradict myself,(I am large, I contain multitudes.)I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?Who wishes to walk with me?Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?                                                 Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me.Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.Our frigate takes fire,The other asks if we demand quarter?If our colors are struck and the fighting done?Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our          part of the fighting.Only three guns are in use,One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main- mast,Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.Not a moment's cease,The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder- magazine.One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.Serene stands the little captain,He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.                                                 Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer'd,The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers,The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,These so, these irretrievable.                                                 You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,See myself in prison shaped like another man,And feel the dull unintermitted pain.For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him and walk by his side,(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.                                                 Enough! enough! enough!Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.That I could forget the mockers and insults!That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludg- eons and hammers!That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.I remember now,I resume the overstaid fraction,The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.Eleves, I salute you! come forward!Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.                                                 The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd head, laughter, and naivetè,Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.                                                 A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may         see and remark, and say Whose?Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,Growing among black folks as among white,Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly will I use you curling grass,It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,And here you are the mothers' laps.This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,Darker than the colorless beards of old men,Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.What do you think has become of the young and old men?And what do you think has become of the women and chil- dren?They are alive and well somewhere,The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.                                                 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.I heard what was said of the universe,Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?Magnifying and applying come I,Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,)Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel,Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke         or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars,Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born,Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then,The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious;By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the shadows.                                                 Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,(I tell not the fall of Alamo,Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war.They were the glory of the race of rangers,Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,Not a single one over thirty years of age.The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.None obey'd the command to kneel,Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers sawthem there,Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of muskets,A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more came to release him,The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.                                                 I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.I chant the chant of dilation or pride,We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,I show that size is only development.Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.Press close bare-bosom'd night—press close magnetic nourishing night!Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!Far-swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blossom'd earth!Smile, for your lover comes.Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!O unspeakable passionate love.                                                 You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.Sea of stretch'd ground-swells,Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready graves,Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.I am he attesting sympathy,(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,I moisten the roots of all that has grown.Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and rectified?I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,There is no better than it and now.What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.                                                 Endless unfolding of words of ages!And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.A word of the faith that never balks,Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time abso- lutely.It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.I accept Reality and dare not question it,Materialism first and last imbuing.Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.Less the reminders of properties told my words,And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.                                                 Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,No more modest than immodest.Unscrew the locks from the doors!Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!Whoever degrades another degrades me,And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the cur- rent and index.I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.Through me many long dumb voices,Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,And of the rights of them the others are down upon,Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.Through me forbidden voices,Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.I do not press my fingers across my mouth,I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.I believe in the flesh and the appetites,Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,Translucent mould of me it shall be you!Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!Firm masculine colter it shall be you!Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!Sun so generous it shall be you!Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the meta- physics of books.To behold the day-break!The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,The air tastes good to my palate.Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,Scooting obliquely high and low.Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,The mocking taunt. See then whether you shall be master!                                                 The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.                                                 With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer'd and slain persons.Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.I beat and pound for the dead,I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.Vivas to those who have fail'd!And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!And to those themselves who sank in the sea!And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!                                                 This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appoint- ments with all,I will not have a single person slighted or left away,The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;There shall be no difference between them and the rest.This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.Do you take it I would astonish?Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?Do I astonish more than they?This hour I tell things in confidence,I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.                                                 Ah, not this marble, dead and cold:  Far from its base and shaft expanding—the round zones circling,          comprehending,  Thou, Washington, art all the world's, the continents' entire—          not yours alone, America,  Europe's as well, in every part, castle of lord or laborer's cot,  Or frozen North, or sultry South—the African's—the Arab's in          his tent,  Old Asia's there with venerable smile, seated amid her ruins;  (Greets the antique the hero new? ‘tis but the same—the heir          legitimate, continued ever,  The indomitable heart and arm—proofs of the never-broken          line,  Courage, alertness, patience, faith, the same—e'en in defeat           defeated not, the same:)  Wherever sails a ship, or house is built on land, or day or night,  Through teeming cities' streets, indoors or out, factories or farms,  Now, or to come, or past—where patriot wills existed or exist,  Wherever Freedom, pois'd by Toleration, sway'd by Law,  Stands or is rising thy true monument.                                                 The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch'd wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce merely,Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers or the anchor-lifters of the departing,Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops selling goods from the rest of the earth,Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place where money is plentiest,Nor the place of the most numerous population.Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards,Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them in return and understands them,Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds,Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of elected persons,Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript waves,Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority,Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President, Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for pay,Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves,Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men,Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,There the great city stands.                                                 Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the day- break.My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,I underlying causes to balance them at last,My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.Writing and talk do not prove me,I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.                                                 The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,I go with the team also.In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,Absorbing all to myself and for this song.Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,They rise together, they slowly circle around.I believe in those wing'd purposes,And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.                                                 Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,Say, old top-knot, what do you want?Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,When I give I give myself.You there, impotent, loose in the knees,Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,And any thing I have I bestow.I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,On his right cheek I put the family kiss,And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes,(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door,Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,Let the physician and the priest go home.I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,O despairer, here is my neck,By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.                                                 I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,And you must not be abased to the other.Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,And that a kelson of the creation is love,And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.                                                 If I should need to name, O Western World, your powerfulest scene and show,‘Twould not be you, Niagara—nor you, ye limitless prairies—nor your huge rifts of canyons, Colorado,Nor you, Yosemite—nor Yellowstone, with all its spasmic geyser-loops ascending to the skies, appearing   and disappearing,Nor Oregon's white cones—nor Huron's belt of mighty lakes—nor Mississippi's stream:—This seething hemisphere's humanity, as now, I'd name—the still small voice vibrating—America's   choosing day,(The heart of it not in the chosen—the act itself the main, the quadriennial choosing,)The stretch of North and South arous'd—sea-board and inland—Texas to Maine—the Prairie States—Vermont,   Virginia, California,The final ballot-shower from East to West—the paradox and conflict,The countless snow-flakes falling—(a swordless conflict,Yet more than all Rome's wars of old, or modern Napoleon's:) the peaceful choice of all,Or good or ill humanity—welcoming the darker odds, the dross:—Foams and ferments the wine? it serves to purify—while the heart pants, life glows:These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships,Swell'd Washington's, Jefferson's, Lincoln's sails.                                                 Upon this scene, this show,Yielded to-day by fashion, learning, wealth,(Nor in caprice alone- some grains of deepest meaning,)Haply, aloft, (who knows?) from distant sky-clouds' blended shapes,As some old tree, or rock or cliff, thrill'd with its soul,Product of Nature's sun, stars, earth direct- a towering human form,In hunting-shirt of film, arm'd with the rifle, a half-ironicalsmile curving its phantom lips,Like one of Ossian's ghosts looks down.                                                 The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.The last scud of day holds back for me,It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds,It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,And filter and fibre your blood.Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,Missing me one place search another,I stop somewhere waiting for you.                                                 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,I see in them and myself the same old law.The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,They scorn the best I can do to relate them.I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,Scattering it freely forever.                                                 What hurrying human tides, or day or night!What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!What curious questioning glances- glints of love!Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!Thou portal- thou arena- thou of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups!(Could but thy flagstones, curbs, facades, tell their inimitable tales;Thy windows rich, and huge hotels- thy side-walks wide;)Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet!Thou, like the parti-colored world itself- like infinite, teeming,mocking life!Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!                            I SEE before me now, a traveling army halting;   Below, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of         summer;   Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising         high;   Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily         seen;   The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the         mountain;   The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized flickering;   And over all, the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,         breaking out, the eternal stars.                            A MASK--a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,   Concealing her face, concealing her form,   Changes and transformations every hour, every moment,   Falling upon her even when she sleeps.                                                 I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the   beginning and the endBut I do not talk of the beginning or the end.There was never any more inception than there is now,Nor any more youth or age than there is now,And will never be any more perfection than there is now,Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.Urge and urge and urge,Always the procreant urge of the world.Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and   increase, always sex,Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of   life.To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is   so.Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well   entretied, braced in the beams,Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,I and this mystery here we stand.Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not   my soul.Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they   discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty   and clean,Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be   less familiar than the rest.I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing; As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the   night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread.Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house   with their plenty,Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my   eyes,That they turn from gazing after and down the road,And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is   ahead?                                                 For the lands, and for these passionate days, and for myself,Now I awhile return to thee, O soil of autumn fields,Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,Tuning a verse for thee.O Earth, that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,O harvest of my lands—O boundless Summer growths!O lavish brown parturient earth—O infinite, teeming womb.A song to narrate thee.2Ever upon this stage,Is acted God's calm, annual drama,Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,The lilliput countless armies of the grass,The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,The scenery of the snows, the wind's free orchestra,The stretching, light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the silvery fringes,The high dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,The shows of all the varied soils, and all the growths and products,The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.3Fecund America—to-day,Thou art all over set in births and joys!Thou groan'st with riches! thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing garment,Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,A myriad-twining life, like interlacing vines, binds all thy vast demesne,As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into port,As rain falls from the heaven, and vapors rise from the earth, so have the precious values fallen upon thee, and risen out of thee;Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon thy world, and lookest East, and lookest West,Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million farms, and missest nothing,Thou all-acceptress—thou hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as God is hospitable.)4When late I sang sad was my voice;Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and smoke of war;In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.But now I sing not War,Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,Nor the regiments hastily coming up, deploying in line of battle;No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping armies?Ask room alas the ghastly ranks—the armies dread that follow'd.(Pass—pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping, sinewy legs,With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your muskets;How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd.Pass;—then rattle drums again,For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhea, with your fever,O my land's maimed darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and the crutch,Lo, your pallid army follows.)5But on these days of brightness, On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns, Should the dead intrude?Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.Nor do I forget you Departed;Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace, like pleasing phantoms, Your memories rising glide silently by me.6I saw the day the return of the heroes;(Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,Them that day I saw not.)I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of mighty camps.No holiday soldiers—youthful, yet veterans,Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.A pause—the armies wait,A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,They melt, they disappear.Exult O lands! victorious lands!Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields;But here and hence your victory.Melt, melt away, ye armies—disperse, ye blue-clad soldiers,Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars.7Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,I see the true arenas of my race and land—or first or last,Man's innocent and strong arenas.I see the heroes at other toils,I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.I see where the Mother of All,With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,And counts the varied gathering of the products.Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring grass.8Toil on heroes! harvest the products!Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.Well-pleased America thou beholdest,Over the fields of the West, those crawling monsters,The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;Beholdest, moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving hay-rakes,The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines,The engines, thrashers of grain, and cleaners of grain, well separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork;Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the rice-cleanser.Beneath thy look O Maternal,With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.All gather and all harvest;Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in security,Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great face only,Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear under thee,Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its light-green sheath,Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches of grapes from the vines,Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,Under the beaming sun and under thee.                            VIGIL strange I kept on the field one night:   When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side that day,   One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd, with a look I         shall never forget;   One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the         ground;   Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle;   Till late in the night reliev'd, to the place at last again I made my         way;   Found you in death so cold, dear comrade--found your body, son of         responding kisses, (never again on earth responding;)   Bared your face in the starlight--curious the scene--cool blew the         moderate night-wind;   Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battlefield         spreading;   Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent         night;                                                       10   But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh--Long, long I gazed;   Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my         chin in my hands;   Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you, dearest         comrade--Not a tear, not a word;   Vigil of silence, love and death--vigil for you my son and my         soldier,   As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole;   Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your         death,   I faithfully loved you and cared for you living--I think we shall         surely meet again;)   Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn         appear'd,   My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,   Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and         carefully under feet;                                        20   And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his         grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited;   Ending my vigil strange with that--vigil of night and battlefield         dim;   Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth         responding;)   Vigil for comrade swiftly slain--vigil I never forget, how as day         brighten'd,   I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his         blanket,   And buried him where he fell.                                                 O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, perfumed South! My South! O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good and evil! O all dear to me! O dear to me my birth-things—All moving things, and the trees where I wasborn—thegrains,plants, rivers; Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, distant, over flats of silverysands,orthrough swamps; Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee,theCoosa, and the Sabine;O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my Soul to haunt their banks again; Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes—I float on the Okeechobee—I crossthehummock land, or through pleasant openings, or dense forests; I see the parrots in the woods—I see the papaw tree and the blossoming titi; Again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, I coast off Georgia—I coast up the Carolinas, I see where the live-oak is growing—I see where the yellow-pine, the scentedbay-tree, thelemon and orange, the cypress, the graceful palmetto;I pass rude sea-headlands and enter Pamlico Sound through an inlet, and dart my visioninland; O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp! The cactus, guarded with thorns—the laurel-tree, with large white flowers; The range afar—the richness and barrenness—the old woods charged with mistletoeandtrailing moss, The piney odor and the gloom—the awful natural stillness, (Here in these dense swampsthefreebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave has his conceal'd hut;)O the strange fascination of these half-known, half-impassable swamps, infested byreptiles,resounding with the bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl and thewild-cat,andthe whirr of the rattlesnake; The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon—singing through themoon-litnight, The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum; A Tennessee corn-field—the tall, graceful, long-leav'd corn—slender,flapping,brightgreen with tassels—with beautiful ears, each well-sheath'd in its husk; An Arkansas prairie—a sleeping lake, or still bayou;O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs—I can stand them not—I will depart; O to be a Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian! O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Tennessee, and never wander more!                            TO the leaven'd soil they trod, calling, I sing, for the last;   (Not cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead,   But forth from my tent emerging for good--loosing, untying the tent-         ropes;)   In the freshness, the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits         and vistas, again to peace restored,   To the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas beyond--to the         south and the north;   To the leaven'd soil of the general western world, to attest my         songs,   (To the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of war and peace,)   To the Alleghanian hills, and the tireless Mississippi,   To the rocks I, calling, sing, and all the trees in the woods,   To the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie spreading         wide,                                                        10   To the far-off sea, and the unseen winds, and the same impalpable         air;   ... And responding, they answer all, (but not in words,)   The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely;   The prairie draws me close, as the father, to bosom broad, the son;   The Northern ice and rain, that began me, nourish me to the end;   But the hot sun of the South is to ripen my songs.                                                 Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;   When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,   One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall never forget,   One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,   Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,   Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,   Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)   Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind,   Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading,  Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,  But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,  Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands,  Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear, not a word,  Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,  As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,  Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,  I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,)  Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,  My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,  Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet,  And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,  Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,  Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)  Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten'd,  I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,  And buried him where he fell.                                                 THESE Carols, sung to cheer my passage through the world I see,   For completion, I dedicate to the Invisible World.                            TURN, O Libertad, for the war is over,   (From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,         sweeping the world,)   Turn from lands retrospective, recording proofs of the past;   From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past;   From the chants of the feudal world--the triumphs of kings, slavery,         caste;   Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that         backward world;   Leave to the singers of hitherto--give them the trailing past;   But what remains, remains for singers for you--wars to come are for         you;   (Lo! how the wars of the past have duly inured to you--and the wars         of the present also inure:)   --Then turn, and be not alarm'd, O Libertad--turn your undying         face,                                                        10   To where the future, greater than all the past,   Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.                            THICK-SPRINKLED bunting! Flag of stars!   Long yet your road, fateful flag!--long yet your road, and lined with         bloody death!   For the prize I see at issue, at last is the world!   All its ships and shores I see, interwoven with your threads, greedy         banner!   --Dream'd again the flags of kings, highest born, to flaunt         unrival'd?   O hasten, flag of man! O with sure and steady step, passing highest         flags of kings,   Walk supreme to the heavens, mighty symbol--run up above them all,   Flag of stars! thick-sprinkled bunting!                                                 THOU reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I,   Therefore for thee the following chants.                                                 THOU orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!   Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,   The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,   And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;   O sun of noon rufulgent! my special word to thee.   Hear me illustrious!   Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,   Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge, thy         touching-distant beams enough,   Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my         invocation.   (Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,                      10   I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,   Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice--and         thou O sun,   As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of         flame gigantic,   I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)   Thou that with fructifying heat and light,   O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North and South,   O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains,         Kanada's woods,   O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,   Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas,   Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so         liberally,                                                   20   Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of thy         million millions,   Strike through these chants.   Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,   Prepare the later afternoon of me myself--prepare my lengthening         shadows,   Prepare my starry nights.                            HERE, take this gift!   I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or General,   One who should serve the good old cause, the great Idea, the progress         and freedom of the race;   Some brave confronter of despots--some daring rebel;   --But I see that what I was reserving, belongs to you just as much as         to any.                                                 TRICKLE, drops! my blue veins leaving!   O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,   Candid, from me falling--drip, bleeding drops,   From wounds made to free you whence you were prison'd,   From my face--from my forehead and lips,   From my breast--from within where I was conceal'd--press forth, red          drops--confession drops;   Stain every page--stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody          drops;   Let them know your scarlet heat--let them glisten;   Saturate them with yourself, all ashamed and wet;   Glow upon all I have written, or shall write, bleeding drops;      10   Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.                             THE world below the brine;   Forests at the bottom of the sea--the branches and leaves,   Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds--the thick         tangle, the openings, and the pink turf,   Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold--the         play of light through the water,   Dumb swimmers there among the rocks--coral, gluten, grass, rushes--         and the aliment of the swimmers,   Sluggish existences grazing there, suspended, or slowly crawling         close to the bottom,   The sperm-whale at the surface, blowing air and spray, or disporting         with his flukes,   The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard,         and the sting-ray;   Passions there--wars, pursuits, tribes--sight in those ocean-depths--         breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do;   The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed         by beings like us, who walk this sphere;                     10   The change onward from ours, to that of beings who walk other         spheres.                            WE two--how long we were fool'd!   Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;   We are Nature--long have we been absent, but now we return;   We become plants, leaves, foliage, roots, bark;   We are bedded in the ground--we are rocks;   We are oaks--we grow in the openings side by side;   We browse--we are two among the wild herds, spontaneous as any;   We are two fishes swimming in the sea together;   We are what the locust blossoms are--we drop scent around the lanes,         mornings and evenings;   We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals;       10   We are two predatory hawks--we soar above, and look down;   We are two resplendent suns--we it is who balance ourselves, orbic         and stellar--we are as two comets;   We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods--we spring on prey;   We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving overhead;   We are seas mingling--we are two of those cheerful waves, rolling         over each other, and interwetting each other;   We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious,         impervious:   We are snow, rain, cold, darkness--we are each product and influence         of the globe;   We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again--we two         have;   We have voided all but freedom, and all but our own joy.                            COURAGE yet! my brother or my sister!   Keep on! Liberty is to be subserv'd, whatever occurs;   That is nothing, that is quell'd by one or two failures, or any         number of failures,   Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any         unfaithfulness,   Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.   Revolt! and still revolt! revolt!   What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,         and all the islands and archipelagos of the sea;   What we believe in invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness         and light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,   Waiting patiently, waiting its time.   (Not songs of loyalty alone are these,                             10   But songs of insurrection also;   For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel, the world over,   And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,   And stakes his life, to be lost at any moment.)   Revolt! and the downfall of tyrants!   The battle rages with many a loud alarm, and frequent advance and         retreat,   The infidel triumphs--or supposes he triumphs,   Then the prison, scaffold, garrote, hand-cuffs, iron necklace and         anklet, lead-balls, do their work,   The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,   The great speakers and writers are exiled--they lie sick in distant         lands,                                                       20   The cause is asleep--the strongest throats are still, choked with         their own blood,   The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;   --But for all this, liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the         infidel enter'd into full possession.   When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go, nor the         second or third to go,   It waits for all the rest to go--it is the last.   When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,   And when all life, and all the souls of men and women are discharged         from any part of the earth,   Then only shall liberty, or the idea of liberty, be discharged from         that part of the earth,   And the infidel come into full possession.   Then courage! European revolter! revoltress!                       30   For, till all ceases, neither must you cease.   I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself,         nor what anything is for,)   But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,   In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are         great.   Revolt! and the bullet for tyrants!   Did we think victory great?   So it is--But now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that         defeat is great,   And that death and dismay are great.                                                 WHAT place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?   Lo! I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal;   And with him horse and foot--and parks of artillery,   And artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.                                                 THOU who hast slept all night upon the storm,   Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions,   (Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,   And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee,)   Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating,   As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,   (Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating vast.)   Far, far at sea,   After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shores with wrecks,   With re-appearing day as now so happy and serene,                  10   The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,   The limpid spread of air cerulean,   Thou also re-appearest.   Thou born to match the gale, (thou art all wings,)   To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,   Thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,   Days, even weeks untired and onward, through spaces, realms gyrating,   At dusk that look'st on Senegal, at morn America,   That sport'st amid the lightning-flash and thunder-cloud,   In them, in thy experience, had'st thou my soul,                   20   What joys! what joys were thine!                                                 O to make the most jubilant song!Full of music-full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!Full of common employments-full of grain and trees.O for the voices of animals-O for the swiftness and balance of fishes!O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!O the joy of my spirit-it is uncaged-it darts like lightning!It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,I will have thousands of globes and all time.O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle, thelaughing locomotive!To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist freshstillness of the woods,The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through theforenoon.O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the coolgurgling by the ears and hair.O the fireman's joys!I hear the alarm at dead of night,I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena inperfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet hisopponent.O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the humansoul is capable of generating and emitting in steady andlimitless floods.O the mother's joys!The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, thepatiently yielded life.O the of increase, growth, recuperation,The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.O to go back to the place where I was born,To hear the birds sing once more,To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast,To continue and be employ'd there all my life,The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at low water,The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,Is the tide out? I Join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesomeyoung man;In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on footon the ice-I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,my brood of tough boys accompanying me,My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with noone else so well as they love to be with me,By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-potswhere they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,)O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I rowjust before sunrise toward the buoys,I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters aredesperate with their claws as I take them out, I insertwooden pegs in the ‘oints of their pincers,I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to theshore,There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'dtill their color becomes scarlet.Another time mackerel-taking,Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill thewater for miles;Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of thebrown-faced crew;Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand withbraced body,My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out thecoils of slender rope,In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, mycompanions.O boating on the rivers,The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raftand the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cooksupper at evening.(O something pernicious and dread!Something far away from a puny and pious life!Something unproved! something in a trance!Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)O to work in mines, or forging iron,Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ampleand shadow'd space,The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.O to resume the joys of the soldier!To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer-to feel hissympathy!To behold his calmness-to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!To go to battle-to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!To hear the crash of artillery-to see the glittering of the bayonetsand musket-barrels in the sun!To see men fall and die and not complain!To taste the savage taste of blood-to be so devilish!To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezesfanning me,I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There- sheblows!Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest- we descend,wild with excitement,I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,lethargic, basking,I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from hisvigorous arm;O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,running to windward, tows me,Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in thewound,Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving himfast,As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower andnarrower, swiftly cutting the water-I see him die,He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and thenfalls flat and still in the bloody foam.O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,How clear is my mind-how all people draw nigh to me!What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom morethan the bloom of youth?What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?O the orator's joys!To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from theribs and throat,To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,To lead America-to quell America with a great tongue.O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identitythrough materials and loving them, observing charactersand absorbing them,My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses andflesh,My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyeswhich finally see,Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,embraces, procreates.O the farmer's joys!Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,To plough land in the spring for maize,To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along theshore.O to realize space!The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flyingclouds, as one with them.O the joy a manly self-hood!To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known orunknown,To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,To confront with your personality all the other personalities of theearth.Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughingface?Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?Yet O my soul supreme!Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the sufferingand the struggle?The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings dayor night?Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,To meet life as a powerful conqueror,No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, provingmy interior soul impregnable,And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating-the joy of death!The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,for reasons,Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'dto powder, or buried,My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,further offices, eternal uses of the earth.O to attract by more than attraction!How it is I know not-yet behold! the something which obeys noneof the rest,It is offensive, never defensive-yet how magnetic it draws.O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns withperfect nonchalance!To be indeed a God!O to sail to sea in a ship!To leave this steady unendurable land,To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and thehouses,To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,To sail and sail and sail!O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.                                                 TWO Rivulets side by side,   Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,   Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey.   For the Eternal Ocean bound,   These ripples, passing surges, streams of Death and Life,   Object and Subject hurrying, whirling by,   The Real and Ideal,   Alternate ebb and flow the Days and Nights,   (Strands of a Trio twining, Present, Future, Past.)   In You, whoe'er you are, my book perusing,                         10   In I myself--in all the World--these ripples flow,   All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.   (O yearnful waves! the kisses of your lips!   Your breast so broad, with open arms, O firm, expanded shore!)                                                 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,I am mad for it to be in contact with me.The smoke of my own breath,Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the pass- ing of blood and air through my lungs,The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the wind,A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look         through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.                            DID YOU ask dulcet rhymes from me?   Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?   Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?   Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor         am I now;   (I have been born of the same as the war was born;   The drum-corps' harsh rattle is to me sweet music--I love well the         martial dirge,   With slow wail, and convulsive throb, leading the officer's funeral:)   --What to such as you, anyhow, such a poet as I?--therefore leave my         works,   And go lull yourself with what you can understand--and with piano-         tunes;   For I lull nobody--and you will never understand me.               10                            TO ORATISTS--to male or female,   Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine power         to use words.   Are you full-lung'd and limber-lipp'd from long trial? from vigorous         practice? from physique?   Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?   Come duly to the divine power to use words?   For only at last, after many years--after chastity, friendship,         procreation, prudence, and nakedness;   After treading ground and breasting river and lake;   After a loosen'd throat--after absorbing eras, temperaments, races--         after knowledge, freedom, crimes;   After complete faith--after clarifyings, elevations, and removing         obstructions;   After these, and more, it is just possible there comes to a man, a         woman, the divine power to use words.                        10   Then toward that man or that woman, swiftly hasten all--None refuse,         all attend;   Armies, ships, antiquities, the dead, libraries, paintings, machines,         cities, hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration,         form in close ranks;   They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the mouth         of that man, or that woman.   .... O I see arise orators fit for inland America;   And I see it is as slow to become an orator as to become a man;   And I see that all power is folded in a great vocalism.   Of a great vocalism, the merciless light thereof shall pour, and the         storm rage,   Every flash shall be a revelation, an insult,   The glaring flame on depths, on heights, on suns, on stars,   On the interior and exterior of man or woman,                      20   On the laws of Nature--on passive materials,   On what you called death--(and what to you therefore was death,   As far as there can be death.)                            O BOY of the West!   To you many things to absorb, I teach, to help you become eleve of         mine:   Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins;   If you be not silently selected by lovers, and do not silently select         lovers,   Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine?                                                 WANDERING at morn,   Emerging from the night, from gloomy thoughts--thee in my thoughts,   Yearning for thee, harmonious Union! thee, Singing Bird divine!   Thee, seated coil'd in evil times, my Country, with craft and black         dismay--with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee;   --Wandering--this common marvel I beheld--the parent thrush I         watch'd, feeding its young,   (The singing thrush, whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic,   Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.)   There ponder'd, felt I,   If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be         turn'd,   If vermin so transposed, so used, so bless'd may be,               10   Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;   --Who knows that these may be the lessons fit for you?   From these your future Song may rise, with joyous trills,   Destin'd to fill the world.                            THE noble Sire, fallen on evil days,   I saw, with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,   (Memories of old in abeyance--love and faith in abeyance,)   The insane knife toward the Mother of All.   The noble Son, on sinewy feet advancing,   I saw--out of the land of prairies--land of Ohio's waters, and of         Indiana,   To the rescue, the stalwart giant, hurry his plenteous offspring,   Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.   Then the Mother of All, with calm voice speaking,   As to you, Virginia, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against         me--and why seek my life?                                    10   When you yourself forever provide to defend me?   For you provided me Washington--and now these also.                            I HEARD that you ask'd for something to prove this puzzle, the New         World,   And to define America, her athletic Democracy;   Therefore I send you my poems, that you behold in them what you         wanted.                            YOU who celebrate bygones!   Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races--the life         that has exhibited itself;   Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,         rulers and priests;   I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself,         in his own rights,   Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, (the         great pride of man in himself;)   Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,   I project the history of the future.                            UNFOLDED out of the folds of the woman, man comes unfolded, and is         always to come unfolded;   Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth, is to come the         superbest man of the earth;   Unfolded out of the friendliest woman, is to come the friendliest         man;   Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman, can a man be form'd         of perfect body;   Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of the woman, can come the         poems of man--(only thence have my poems come;)   Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only thence can         appear the strong and arrogant man I love;   Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman I love, only         thence come the brawny embraces of the man;   Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain, come all the folds of         the man's brain, duly obedient;   Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice is unfolded;   Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy:         10   A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through eternity--but         every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman,   First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in         himself.                                                 And who art thou? said I to the soft-falling shower,Which, strange to tell, gave me an answer, as here translated:I am the Poem of Earth, said the voice of the rain,Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea,Upward to heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed, andyet the same,I descend to lave the drouths, atomies, dust-layers of the globe,And all that in them without me were seeds only, latent, unborn;And forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own origin,and make pure and beautify it;(For song, issuing from its birth-place, after fulfilment, wandering,Reck'd or unreck'd, duly with love returns.)                                                 WHAT General has a good army in himself, has a good army;    He happy in himself, or she happy in herself, is happy,   But I tell you you cannot be happy by others, any more than you can         beget or conceive a child by others.                            WHAT you give me, I cheerfully accept,   A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money--these, as I         rendezvous with my poems;   A traveler's lodging and breakfast as I journey through The States--         Why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? Why to advertise for         them?   For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman;   For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of         the universe.                            WHY reclining, interrogating? Why myself and all drowsing?   What deepening twilight! scum floating atop of the waters!   Who are they, as bats and night-dogs, askant in the Capitol?   What a filthy Presidentiad! (O south, your torrid suns! O north, your         arctic freezings!)   Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that the         President?   Then I will sleep awhile yet--for I see that These States sleep, for         reasons;   (With gathering murk--with muttering thunder and lambent shoots, we         all duly awake,   South, north, east, west, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)                                                 THE sobbing of the bells, the sudden death-news everywhere,   The slumberers rouse, the rapport of the People,   (Full well they know that message in the darkness,   Full well return, respond within their breasts, their brains, the sad         reverberations,)   The passionate toll and clang--city to city, joining, sounding,         passing,   Those heart-beats of a Nation in the night.                            TO thee, old Cause!   Thou peerless, passionate, good cause!   Thou stern, remorseless, sweet Idea!   Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands!   After a strange, sad war--great war for thee,   (I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be         really fought, for thee;)   These chants for thee--the eternal march of thee.   Thou orb of many orbs!   Thou seething principle! Thou well-kept, latent germ! Thou centre!   Around the idea of thee the strange sad war revolving,             10   With all its angry and vehement play of causes,   (With yet unknown results to come, for thrice a thousand years,)   These recitatives for thee--my Book and the War are one,   Merged in its spirit I and mine--as the contest hinged on thee,   As a wheel on its axis turns, this Book, unwitting to itself,   Around the Idea of thee.                                                 THIS day, O Soul, I give you a wondrous mirror;   Long in the dark, in tarnish and cloud it lay--But the cloud has         pass'd, and the tarnish gone;   ... Behold, O Soul! it is now a clean and bright mirror,   Faithfully showing you all the things of the world.                            SOMETHING startles me where I thought I was safest;   I withdraw from the still woods I loved;   I will not go now on the pastures to walk;   I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea;   I will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew         me.   O how can it be that the ground does not sicken?   How can you be alive, you growths of spring?   How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards,         grain?   Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?   Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?        10   Where have you disposed of their carcasses?   Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations;   Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?   I do not see any of it upon you to-day--or perhaps I am deceiv'd;   I will run a furrow with my plough--I will press my spade through the         sod, and turn it up underneath;   I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.   Behold this compost! behold it well!   Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person--Yet behold!   The grass of spring covers the prairies,   The bean bursts noislessly through the mould in the garden,        20   The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,   The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,   The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its         graves,   The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,   The he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit on         their nests,   The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,   The new-born of animals appear--the calf is dropt from the cow, the         colt from the mare,   Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green         leaves,   Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk--the lilacs bloom in the         door-yards;   The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata         of sour dead.                                                30   What chemistry!   That the winds are really not infectious,   That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which         is so amorous after me,   That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its         tongues,   That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited         themselves in it,   That all is clean forever and forever.   That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,   That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,   That the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-orchard--that         melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,   That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,       40   Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a         catching disease.   Now I am terrified at the Earth! it is that calm and patient,   It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,   It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless         successions of diseas'd corpses,   It distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,   It renews with such unwitting looks, its prodigal, annual, sumptuous         crops,   It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from         them at last.                            NATIONS ten thousand years before These States, and many times ten         thousand years before These States;   Garner'd clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and         travel'd their course, and pass'd on;   What vast-built cities--what orderly republics--what pastoral tribes         and nomads;   What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others;   What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions;   What sort of marriage--what costumes--what physiology and phrenology;   What of liberty and slavery among them--what they thought of death         and the soul;   Who were witty and wise--who beautiful and poetic--who brutish and         undevelop'd;   Not a mark, not a record remains--And yet all remains.   O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than         we are for nothing;                                          10   I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much         as we now belong to it, and as all will henceforth belong to         it.   Afar they stand--yet near to me they stand,   Some with oval countenances, learn'd and calm,   Some naked and savage--Some like huge collections of insects,   Some in tents--herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,   Some prowling through woods--Some living peaceably on farms,         laboring, reaping, filling barns,   Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories,         libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.   Are those billions of men really gone?   Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?   Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?                   20   Did they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?   I believe of all those billions of men and women that fill'd the         unnamed lands, every one exists this hour, here or elsewhere,         invisible to us, in exact proportion to what he or she grew         from in life, and out of what he or she did, felt, became,         loved, sinn'd, in life.   I believe that was not the end of those nations, or any person of         them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of         me;   Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products,         games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,         I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen         world--counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world.   I suspect I shall meet them there,   I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed         lands.                            IS reform needed? Is it through you?   The greater the reform needed, the greater the personality you need         to accomplish it.   You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood,         complexion, clean and sweet?   Do you not see how it would serve to have such a Body and Soul, that         when you enter the crowd, an atmosphere of desire and command         enters with you, and every one is impress'd with your         personality?   O the magnet! the flesh over and over!   Go, dear friend! if need be, give up all else, and commence to-day to         inure yourself to pluck, reality, self-esteem, definiteness,         elevatedness;   Rest not, till you rivet and publish yourself of your own         personality.                            OF obedience, faith, adhesiveness;   As I stand aloof and look, there is to me something profoundly         affecting in large masses of men, following the lead of those         who do not believe in men.                                                 NOW, dearest comrade, lift me to your face,   We must separate awhile--Here! take from my lips this kiss.   Whoever you are, I give it especially to you;   So long!--And I hope we shall meet again.                            MY spirit to yours, dear brother;   Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do not understand you;   I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there are others         also;)   I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you, and to salute         those who are with you, before and since--and those to come         also,   That we all labor together, transmitting the same charge and         succession;   We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of times;   We, enclosers of all continents, all castes--allowers of all         theologies,   Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,   We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the         disputers, nor any thing that is asserted;   We hear the bawling and din--we are reach'd at by divisions,         jealousies, recriminations on every side,                    10   They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my comrade,   Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and         down, till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the         diverse eras,   Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages         to come, may prove brethren and lovers, as we are.                                      O sight of shame, and pain, and dole!             O fearful thought--a convict Soul!   RANG the refrain along the hall, the prison,   Rose to the roof, the vaults of heaven above,   Pouring in floods of melody, in tones so pensive, sweet and strong,         the like whereof was never heard,   Reaching the far-off sentry, and the armed guards, who ceas'd their         pacing,   Making the hearer's pulses stop for extasy and awe.             O sight of pity, gloom, and dole!             O pardon me, a hapless Soul!   The sun was low in the west one winter day,                        10   When down a narrow aisle, amid the thieves and outlaws of the land,   (There by the hundreds seated, sear-faced murderers, wily         counterfeiters,   Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls--the keepers round,   Plenteous, well-arm'd, watching, with vigilant eyes,)   All that dark, cankerous blotch, a nation's criminal mass,   Calmly a Lady walk'd, holding a little innocent child by either hand,   Whom, seating on their stools beside her on the platform,   She, first preluding with the instrument, a low and musical prelude,   In voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn.                               THE HYMN.   A Soul, confined by bars and bands,                                20   Cries, Help! O help! and wrings her hands;   Blinded her eyes--bleeding her breast,   Nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest.     O sight of shame, and pain, and dole!     O fearful thought--a convict Soul!   Ceaseless, she paces to and fro;   O heart-sick days! O nights of wo!   Nor hand of friend, nor loving face;   Nor favor comes, nor word of grace.     O sight of pity, gloom, and dole!                                30     O pardon me, a hapless Soul!   It was not I that sinn'd the sin,   The ruthless Body dragg'd me in;   Though long I strove courageously,   The Body was too much for me.     O Life! no life, but bitter dole!     O burning, beaten, baffled Soul!   (Dear prison'd Soul, bear up a space,   For soon or late the certain grace;   To set thee free, and bear thee home,                              40   The Heavenly Pardoner, Death shall come.     Convict no more--nor shame, nor dole!     Depart! a God-enfranchis'd Soul!)   The singer ceas'd;   One glance swept from her clear, calm eyes, o'er all those upturn'd         faces;   Strange sea of prison faces--a thousand varied, crafty, brutal,         seam'd and beauteous faces;   Then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,   While her gown touch'd them, rustling in the silence,   She vanish'd with her children in the dusk.   While upon all, convicts and armed keepers, ere they stirr'd,      50   (Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,)   A hush and pause fell down, a wondrous minute,   With deep, half-stifled sobs, and sound of bad men bow'd, and moved         to weeping,   And youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home,   The mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy         childhood,   The long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence;   --A wondrous minute then--But after, in the solitary night, to many,         many there,   Years after--even in the hour of death--the sad refrain--the tune,         the voice, the words,   Resumed--the large, calm Lady walks the narrow aisle,   The wailing melody again--the singer in the prison sings:          60     O sight of shame, and pain, and dole!     O fearful thought--a convict Soul!                            ON my northwest coast in the midst of the night, a fishermen's group         stands watching;   Out on the lake, that expands before them, others are spearing         salmon;   The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,   Bearing a Torch a-blaze at the prow.                            WARBLE me now, for joy of Lilac-time,   Sort me, O tongue and lips, for Nature's sake, and sweet life's         sake--and death's the same as life's,   Souvenirs of earliest summer--birds' eggs, and the first berries;   Gather the welcome signs, (as children, with pebbles, or stringing         shells;)   Put in April and May--the hylas croaking in the ponds--the elastic         air,   Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,   Blue-bird, and darting swallow--nor forget the high-hole flashing his         golden wings,   The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,   Spiritual, airy insects, humming on gossamer wings,   Shimmer of waters, with fish in them--the cerulean above;          10   All that is jocund and sparkling--the brooks running,   The maple woods, the crisp February days, and the sugar-making;   The robin, where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,   With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,   Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest         of his mate;   The melted snow of March--the willow sending forth its yellow-green         sprouts;   --For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it         and from it?   Thou, Soul, unloosen'd--the restlessness after I know not what;   Come! let us lag here no longer--let us be up and away!   O for another world! O if one could but fly like a bird!           20   O to escape--to sail forth, as in a ship!   To glide with thee, O Soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the         waters!   --Gathering these hints, these preludes--the blue sky, the grass, the         morning drops of dew;   (With additional songs--every spring will I now strike up additional         songs,   Nor ever again forget, these tender days, the chants of Death as well         as Life;)   The lilac-scent, the bushes, and the dark green, heart-shaped leaves,   Wood violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,   Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,   To tally, drench'd with them, tested by them,   Cities and artificial life, and all their sights and scenes,       30   My mind henceforth, and all its meditations--my recitatives,   My land, my age, my race, for once to serve in songs,   (Sprouts, tokens ever of death indeed the same as life,)   To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,   A warble for joy of Lilac-time.                            THIS moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,   It seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and         thoughtful;   It seems to me I can look over and behold them, in Germany, Italy,         France, Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or         India--talking other dialects;   And it seems to me if I could know those men, I should become         attached to them, as I do to men in my own lands;   O I know we should be brethren and lovers,   I know I should be happy with them.                            WEAVE in! weave in, my hardy life!   Weave yet a soldier strong and full, for great campaigns to come;   Weave in red blood! weave sinews in, like ropes! the senses, sight         weave in!   Weave lasting sure! weave day and night the weft, the warp, incessant         weave! tire not!   (We know not what the use, O life! nor know the aim, the end--nor         really aught we know;   But know the work, the need goes on, and shall go on--the death-         envelop'd march of peace as well as war goes on;)   For great campaigns of peace the same, the wiry threads to weave;   We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave.                            TO THE garden, the world, anew ascending,   Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,   The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,   Curious, here behold my resurrection, after slumber;   The revolving cycles, in their wide sweep, have brought me again,   Amorous, mature--all beautiful to me--all wondrous;   My limbs, and the quivering fire that ever plays through them, for         reasons, most wondrous;   Existing, I peer and penetrate still,   Content with the present--content with the past,   By my side, or back of me, Eve following,                          10   Or in front, and I following her just the same.                            NOW I make a leaf of Voices--for I have found nothing mightier than         they are,   And I have found that no word spoken, but is beautiful, in its place.   O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?   Surely, whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall         follow,   As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere         around the globe.   All waits for the right voices;   Where is the practis'd and perfect organ? Where is the develop'd         Soul?   For I see every word utter'd thence, has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,         impossible on less terms.   I see brains and lips closed--tympans and temples unstruck,   Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,   10   Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies         slumbering, forever ready, in all words.                            THESE, I, singing in spring, collect for lovers,   (For who but I should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and         joy?   And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)   Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world--but soon I pass the         gates,   Now along the pond-side--now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,   Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones thrown there,         pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,   (Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and         partly cover them--Beyond these I pass,)   Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,   Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the         silence,   Alone I had thought--yet soon a troop gathers around me,           10   Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or         neck,   They, the spirits of dear friends, dead or alive--thicker they come,         a great crowd, and I in the middle,   Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them,   Plucking something for tokens--tossing toward whoever is near me;   Here! lilac, with a branch of pine,   Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a live-oak in         Florida, as it hung trailing down,   Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,   And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,   (O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me--and returns again,         never to separate from me,   And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades--this         Calamus-root shall,                                          20   Interchange it, youths, with each other! Let none render it back!)   And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,   And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar:   These, I, compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,   Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from         me,   Indicating to each one what he shall have--giving something to each;   But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,   I will give of it--but only to them that love, as I myself am capable         of loving.                            OF ownership--As if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter         upon all, and incorporate them into himself or herself.   Of waters, forests, hills;   Of the earth at large, whispering through medium of me;   Of vista--Suppose some sight in arriere, through the formative chaos,         presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain'd on the         journey;   (But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)   --Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become         supplied--And of what will yet be supplied,   Because all I see and know, I believe to have purport in what will         yet be supplied.                                                 How dare one say it?After the cycles, poems, singers, plays,Vaunted Ionia's, India's -Homer, Shakespeare -the long, long times, thick dotted roads, areas,The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars -Nature's pulses reaped,All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration,All ages' plummets dropped to their utmost depths,All human lives, throats, wishes, brains -all experiences' utterance;After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands,Still something not yet told in poesy's voice or print -something lacking,(Who knows? the best yet unexpressed and lacking.)                                                 WHAT best I see in thee,   Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,   Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,   Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,   Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted, venerable Asia, swarm'd         upon,   Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's promenade;   But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,   Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,   Ohio's, Indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the         front,   Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round         world's promenade,                                           10   We all so justified.                                                 THINK of the Soul;   I swear to you that body of yours gives proportions to your Soul         somehow to live in other spheres;   I do not know how, but I know it is so.   Think of loving and being loved;   I swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse yourself with such         things that everybody that sees you shall look longingly upon         you.   Think of the past;   I warn you that in a little while others will find their past in you         and your times.   The race is never separated--nor man nor woman escapes;   All is inextricable--things, spirits, Nature, nations, you too--from         precedents you come.   Recall the ever-welcome defiers, (The mothers precede them;)       10   Recall the sages, poets, saviors, inventors, lawgivers, of the earth;   Recall Christ, brother of rejected persons--brother of slaves,         felons, idiots, and of insane and diseas'd persons.   Think of the time when you were not yet born;   Think of times you stood at the side of the dying;   Think of the time when your own body will be dying.   Think of spiritual results,   Sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every one of its         objects pass into spiritual results.   Think of manhood, and you to be a man;   Do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood, nothing?   Think of womanhood, and you to be a woman;                         20   The creation is womanhood;   Have I not said that womanhood involves all?   Have I not told how the universe has nothing better than the best         womanhood?                            I SEE in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as         it pours in the great Sea.                            TO the East and to the West;   To the man of the Seaside State, and of Pennsylvania,   To the Kanadian of the North--to the Southerner I love;   These, with perfect trust, to depict you as myself--the germs are in         all men;   I believe the main purport of These States is to found a superb         friendship, exalté, previously unknown,   Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in         all men.                            WE two boys together clinging,   One the other never leaving,   Up and down the roads going--North and South excursions making,   Power enjoying--elbows stretching--fingers clutching,   Arm'd and fearless--eating, drinking, sleeping, loving,   No law less than ourselves owning--sailing, soldiering, thieving,         threatening,   Misers, menials, priests alarming--air breathing, water drinking, on         the turf or the sea-beach dancing,   Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness         chasing,   Fulfilling our foray.                            WHAT am I, after all, but a child, pleas'd with the sound of my own         name? repeating it over and over;   I stand apart to hear--it never tires me.   To you, your name also;   Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in         the sound of your name?                                                 THE untold want, by life and land ne'er granted,   Now, Voyager, sail thou forth, to seek and find.                            ALL you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages,   You have not learn'd of Nature--of the politics of Nature, you have         not learn'd the great amplitude, rectitude, impartiality;   You have not seen that only such as they are for These States,   And that what is less than they, must sooner or later lift off from         These States.                                                 1 AN old man bending, I come, among new faces,Years looking backward, resuming, in answer to children,Come tell us, old man, as from young men and maidens that love me;(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war, but soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself, To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,Of unsurpass’d heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave Now be witness again—paint the mightiest armies of earth;Of those armies so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,Of hard-fought engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest remains?2O maidens and young men I love, and that love me,What you ask of my days, those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls;Soldier alert I arrive, after a long march, cover’d with sweat and dust;In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge;Enter the captur’d works.... yet lo! like a swift-running river, they fade;Pass and are gone, they fade—I dwell not on soldiers’ perils or soldiers’ joys;(Both I remember well—many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.) But in silence, in dreams’ projections,While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,With hinged knees returning, I enter the doors—(while for you up there,Whoever you are, follow me without noise, and be of strong heart.)3Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,Straight and swift to my wounded I go,Where they lie on the ground, after the battle brought in;Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground;Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof’d hospital;To the long rows of cots, up and down, each side, I return;To each and all, one after another, I draw near—not one do I miss;An attendant follows, holding a tray—he carries a refuse pail,Soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood, emptied and fill’d again. I onward go, I stop,With hinged knees and steady hand, to dress wounds;I am firm with each—the pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable;One turns to me his appealing eyes—(poor boy! I never knew you,Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.) On, on I go!—(open doors of time! open hospital doors!)The crush’d head I dress, (poor crazed hand, tear not the bandage away The neck of the cavalry-man, with the bullet through and through, I examine;Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard;(Come, sweet death! be persuaded, O beautiful death!In mercy come quickly.) From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood;Back on his pillow the soldier bends, with curv’d neck, and side-falling head;His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump,And has not yet look’d on it. I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep;But a day or two more—for see, the frame all wasted already, and sinking,And the yellow-blue countenance see. I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet wound,Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,While the attendant stands behind aside me, holding the tray and pail. I am faithful, I do not give out;The fractur’d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame.) 4 Thus in silence, in dreams’ projections,Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals;The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,I sit by the restless all the dark night—some are so young;Some suffer so much—I recall the experience sweet and sad;(Many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested,Many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)                                                 Whoever you are, I fear you are walking the walks of   dreams,I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your    feet and hands,Even now your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners,    troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,Your true soul and body appear before me,They stand forth out of affairs, out of commerce, shops,    work, farms, clothes, the house, buying, selling, eating,    drinking, suffering, dying.Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you    be my poem,I whisper with my lips close to your ear,I have loved many women and men, but I love none better   than you.O I have been dilatory and dumb,I should have made my way straight to you long ago, I should have blabb’d nothing but you, I should have chanted   nothing but you. I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you, None has understood you, but I understand you, None has done justice to you, you have not done justice to   yourself,None but has found you imperfect, I only find no   imperfection in you,None but would subordinate you, I only am he who will   never consent to subordinate you,I only am he who places over you no master, owner, better,   God, beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself. Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre-   figure of all,From the head of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of    gold-color’d light,But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its    nimbus of gold-color’d light,From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it   streams, effulgently flowing forever.O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you! You have not known what you are, you have slumber’d upon   yourself all your life,Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,What you have done returns already in mockeries, (Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in   mockeries, what is their return?) The mockeries are not you,Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,I pursue you where none else has pursued you,Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the    accustom’d routine, if these conceal you from others or   from yourself, they do not conceal you from me,The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if   these balk others they do not balk me,The pert apparel, the deform’d attitude, drunkenness, greed,    premature death, all these I part aside.There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied    in you,There is no virtue, no beauty in man or woman, but as good    is in you,No pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you,No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits    for you.As for me, I give nothing to any one except I give the like    carefully to you,I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than   I sing the songs of the glory of you.Whoever you are! claim your own at an hazard! These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you, These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are   immense and interminable as they,These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of    apparent dissolution, you are he or she who is master or    mistress over them,Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements,    pain, passion, dissolution.The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing    sufficiency,Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,    whatever you are promulges itself,Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided,    nothing is scanted,Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what    you are picks its way.                         To a Common Prostitute   BE composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty         as Nature;   Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you;   Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you, and the leaves to         rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for         you.   My girl, I appoint with you an appointment--and I charge you that you         make preparation to be worthy to meet me,   And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.   Till then, I salute you with a significant look, that you do not         forget me.                                                 A NEWER garden of creation, no primal solitude,   Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,   With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,   By all the world contributed--freedom's and law's and thrift's         society,   The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,   To justify the past.                            FROM all the rest I single out you, having a message for you:   You are to die--Let others tell you what they please, I cannot         prevaricate,   I am exact and merciless, but I love you--There is no escape for you.   Softly I lay my right hand upon you--you just feel it,   I do not argue--I bend my head close, and half envelope it,   I sit quietly by--I remain faithful,   I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,   I absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodily--that is         eternal--you yourself will surely escape,   The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.   The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions!                 10   Strong thoughts fill you, and confidence--you smile!   You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,   You do not see the medicines--you do not mind the weeping friends--I         am with you,   I exclude others from you--there is nothing to be commiserated,   I do not commiserate--I congratulate you.                            WHAT think you I take my pen in hand to record?   The battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw pass the         offing to-day under full sail?   The splendors of the past day? Or the splendor of the night that         envelopes me?   Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?--         No;   But I record of two simple men I saw to-day, on the pier, in the         midst of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends;   The one to remain hung on the other's neck, and passionately kiss'd         him,   While the one to depart, tightly prest the one to remain in his arms.                            To think of time--of all that retrospection!   To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!   Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?   Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?   Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?   Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?   If the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.   To think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were         flexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!   To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!   To think that we are now here, and bear our part!                  10   Not a day passes--not a minute or second, without an accouchement!   Not a day passes--not a minute or second, without a corpse!   The dull nights go over, and the dull days also,   The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,   The physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible         look for an answer,   The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters         are sent for,   Medicines stand unused on the shelf--(the camphor-smell has long         pervaded the rooms,)   The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the         dying,   The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,   The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,              20   The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,   It is palpable as the living are palpable.   The living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,   But without eye-sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously         on the corpse.   To think the thought of Death, merged in the thought of materials!   To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits         ripen, and act upon others as upon us now--yet not act upon us!   To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking         great interest in them--and we taking no interest in them!   To think how eager we are in building our houses!   To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!   (I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy         or eighty years at most,                                     30   I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)   Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never         cease--they are the burial lines,   He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall         surely be buried.   A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,   A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,   Each after his kind:   Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river,         half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray, discouraged sky         overhead, the short, last daylight of Twelfth-month,   A hearse and stages--other vehicles give place--the funeral of an old         Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.   Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the         gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living         alight, the hearse uncloses,   The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on         the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,                40   The mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,   A minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,   He is decently put away--is there anything more?   He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,         able to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready         with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate         hearty, drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew         low-spirited toward the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a         contribution, died, aged forty-one years--and that was his         funeral.   Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-         weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter,         hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody,         headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's         work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at         night;   To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers--and he         there takes no interest in them!   The markets, the government, the working-man's wages--to think what         account they are through our nights and days!   To think that other working-men will make just as great account of         them--yet we make little or no account!   The vulgar and the refined--what you call sin, and what you call         goodness--to think how wide a difference!   To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie         beyond the difference.                                       50   To think how much pleasure there is!   Have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from         poems?   Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or         planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and         family?   Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the         beautiful maternal cares?   --These also flow onward to others--you and I flow onward,   But in due time, you and I shall take less interest in them.   Your farm, profits, crops,--to think how engross'd you are!   To think there will still be farms, profits, crops--yet for you, of         what avail?   What will be, will be well--for what is, is well,   To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.  60   The sky continues beautiful,   The pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure         of women with men, nor the pleasure from poems,   The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of         houses--these are not phantasms--they have weight, form,         location;   Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them         phantasms,   The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,   The earth is not an echo--man and his life, and all the things of his         life, are well-consider'd.   You are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely         around yourself;   Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!   It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and         father--it is to identify you;   It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be         decided;                                                     70   Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,   You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.   The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp,         the pattern is systematic.   The preparations have every one been justified,   The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments--the baton         has given the signal.   The guest that was coming--he waited long, for reasons--he is now         housed,   He is one of those who are beautiful and happy--he is one of those         that to look upon and be with is enough.   The law of the past cannot be eluded,   The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,   The law of the living cannot be eluded--it is eternal,             80   The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,   The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,   The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons--not one iota thereof         can be eluded.   Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,   Northerner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the         Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and         all through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.   The great masters and kosmos are well as they go--the heroes and         good-doers are well,   The known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and         distinguish'd, may be well,   But there is more account than that--there is strict account of all.   The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,   The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,                 90   The common people of Europe are not nothing--the American aborigines         are not nothing,   The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing--the murderer         or mean person is not nothing,   The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they         go,   The lowest prostitute is not nothing--the mocker of religion is not         nothing as he goes.   Of and in all these things,   I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of         us changed,   I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present         and past law,   And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and         past law,   For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.   If otherwise, all came but to ashes of dung,                      100   If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd!   Then indeed suspicion of death.   Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now,   Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward         annihilation?   Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,   Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,   The whole universe indicates that it is good,   The past and the present indicate that it is good.   How beautiful and perfect are the animals!   How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!            110   What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as         perfect,   The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable         fluids are perfect;   Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely         they yet pass on.   I swear I think now that everything without exception has an eternal Soul!   The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the         animals!   I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!   That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for         it, and the cohering is for it;   And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and         materials are altogether for it!                                                 THEE for my recitative!   Thee in the driving storm, even as now--the snow--the winter-day         declining;   Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy beat         convulsive;   Thy black cylindric body, golden brass, and silvery steel;   Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating,         shuttling at thy sides;   Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar--now tapering in the         distance;   Thy great protruding head-light, fix'd in front;   Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple;   The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack;   Thy knitted frame--thy springs and valves--the tremulous twinkle of         thy wheels;                                                  10   Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,   Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering:   Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of the         continent!   For once, come serve the Muse, and merge in verse, even as here I see         thee,   With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow;   By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes,   By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing.   Fierce-throated beauty!   Roll through my chant, with all thy lawless music! thy swinging lamps         at night;   Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rumbling like an         earthquake, rousing all!                                     20   Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;   (No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)   Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,   Launch'd o'er the prairies wide--across the lakes,   To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.                            TO The States, or any one of them, or any city of The States,         Resist much, obey little;   Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved;   Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city, of this earth, ever         afterward resumes its liberty.                            THE prairie-grass dividing--its special odor breathing,   I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,   Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,   Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,   Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,   Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and         command--leading, not following,   Those with a never-quell'd audacity--those with sweet and lusty         flesh, clear of taint,   Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and Governors,         as to say, Who are you?   Those of earth-born passion, simple, never-constrain'd, never         obedient,   Those of inland America.                                           10                            LO! Victress on the peaks!   Where thou, with mighty brow, regarding the world,   (The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee;)   Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;   Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,   Flauntest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom--lo! in these         hours supreme,   No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee--nor mastery's rapturous         verse;   But a book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,   And psalms of the dead.                            I WANDER all night in my vision,   Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and         stopping,   Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,   Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,   Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.   How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still!   How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles!   The wretched features of ennuyés, the white features of         corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of         onanists,   The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door'd         rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging from gates, and         the dying emerging from gates,   The night pervades them and infolds them.                          10   The married couple sleep calmly in their bed--he with his palm on the         hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the         husband,   The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,   The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,   And the mother sleeps, with her little child carefully wrapt.   The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,   The prisoner sleeps well in the prison--the run-away son sleeps;   The murderer that is to be hung next day--how does he sleep?   And the murder'd person--how does he sleep?   The female that loves unrequited sleeps,   And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,                         20   The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,   And the enraged and treacherous dispositions--all, all sleep.   I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and the         most restless,   I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,   The restless sink in their beds--they fitfully sleep.   Now I pierce the darkness--new beings appear,   The earth recedes from me into the night,   I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is         beautiful.   I go from bedside to bedside--I sleep close with the other sleepers,         each in turn,   I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,          30   And I become the other dreamers.   I am a dance--Play up, there! the fit is whirling me fast!   I am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight,   I see the hiding of douceurs--I see nimble ghosts whichever way I         look,   Cache, and cache again, deep in the ground and sea, and where it is         neither ground or sea.   Well do they do their jobs, those journeymen divine,   Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,   I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides,   And surround me and lead me, and run ahead when I walk,   To lift their cunning covers, to signify me with stretch'd arms, and         resume the way;                                              40   Onward we move! a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting music,         and wild-flapping pennants of joy!   I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician;   The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,   He who has been famous, and he who shall be famous after to-day,   The stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person.   I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,   My truant lover has come, and it is dark.   Double yourself and receive me, darkness!   Receive me and my lover too--he will not let me go without him.   I roll myself upon you, as upon a bed--I resign myself to the         dusk.                                                        50   He whom I call answers me, and takes the place of my lover,   He rises with me silently from the bed.   Darkness! you are gentler than my lover--his flesh was sweaty and         panting,   I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.   My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,   I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.   Be careful, darkness! already, what was it touch'd me?   I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,   I hear the heart-beat--I follow, I fade away.   O hot-cheek'd and blushing! O foolish hectic!                      60   O for pity's sake, no one must see me now! my clothes were stolen         while I was abed,   Now I am thrust forth, where shall I run?   Pier that I saw dimly last night, when I look'd from the windows!   Pier out from the main, let me catch myself with you, and stay--I         will not chafe you,   I feel ashamed to go naked about the world.   I am curious to know where my feet stand--and what this is flooding         me, childhood or manhood--and the hunger that crosses the         bridge between.   The cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking,   Laps life-swelling yolks--laps ear of rose-corn, milky and just         ripen'd;   The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness,   And liquor is spill'd on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the         best liquor afterward.                                       70   I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,   Perfume and youth course through me, and I am their wake.   It is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old woman's,   I sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn my grandson's         stockings.   It is I too, the sleepless widow, looking out on the winter midnight,   I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.   A shroud I see, and I am the shroud--I wrap a body, and lie in the         coffin,   It is dark here under ground--it is not evil or pain here--it is         blank here, for reasons.   It seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be         happy,   Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know he has         enough.                                                      80   I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer, swimming naked through the eddies         of the sea,   His brown hair lies close and even to his head--he strikes out with         courageous arms--he urges himself with his legs,   I see his white body--I see his undaunted eyes,   I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on         the rocks.   What are you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled waves?   Will you kill the courageous giant? Will you kill him in the prime of         his middle age?   Steady and long he struggles,   He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd--he holds out while his strength holds         out,   The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood--they bear him away--         they roll him, swing him, turn him,   His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually         bruis'd on rocks,                                            90   Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.   I turn, but do not extricate myself,   Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.   The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind--the wreck-guns sound,   The tempest lulls--the moon comes floundering through the drifts.   I look where the ship helplessly heads end on--I hear the burst as         she strikes--I hear the howls of dismay--they grow fainter and         fainter.   I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,   I can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze upon me.   I search with the crowd--not one of the company is wash'd to us         alive;   In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a         barn.                                                       100   Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,   Washington stands inside the lines--he stands on the intrench'd         hills, amid a crowd of officers,   His face is cold and damp--he cannot repress the weeping drops,   He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes--the color is blanch'd         from his cheeks,   He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their         parents.   The same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,   He stands in the room of the old tavern--the well-belov'd soldiers         all pass through,   The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,   The chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the         cheek,   He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another--he shakes hands,         and bids good-by to the army.                               110   Now I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat at dinner         together,   Of when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on         the old homestead.   A red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead,   On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,   Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd her         face,   Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as         she spoke.   My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,   She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and         pliant limbs,   The more she look'd upon her, she loved her,   Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,       120   She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace--she cook'd         food for her,   She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and         fondness.   The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the         afternoon she went away,   O my mother was loth to have her go away!   All the week she thought of her--she watch'd for her many a month,   She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,   But the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again.   Now Lucifer was not dead--or if he was, I am his sorrowful terrible         heir;   I have been wrong'd--I am oppress'd--I hate him that oppresses me,   I will either destroy him, or he shall release me.                130   Damn him! how he does defile me!   How he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their         blood!   How he laughs when I look down the bend, after the steamboat that         carries away my woman!   Now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk, it seems mine;   Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my         flukes is death.   A show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an         amour of the light and air!   I am jealous, and overwhelm'd with friendliness,   And will go gallivant with the light and air myself,   And have an unseen something to be in contact with them also.   O love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in me!              140   Autumn and winter are in the dreams--the farmer goes with his thrift,   The droves and crops increase, and the barns are well-fill'd.   Elements merge in the night--ships make tacks in the dreams,   The sailor sails--the exile returns home,   The fugitive returns unharm'd--the immigrant is back beyond months         and years,   The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with         the well-known neighbors and faces,   They warmly welcome him--he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well         off;   The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage         home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,   To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,   The Swiss foots it toward his hills--the Prussian goes his way, the         Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,                    150   The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.   The homeward bound, and the outward bound,   The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist, the         female that loves unrequited, the money-maker,   The actor and actress, those through with their parts, and those         waiting to commence,   The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee         that is chosen, and the nominee that has fail'd,   The great already known, and the great any time after to-day,   The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,   The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced         him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,   The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red         squaw,   The consumptive, the erysipelite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,  160   The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,   I swear they are averaged now--one is no better than the other,   The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.   I swear they are all beautiful;   Every one that sleeps is beautiful--everything in the dim light is         beautiful,   The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.   Peace is always beautiful, The myth of heaven indicates peace and         night.   The myth of heaven indicates the Soul;   The Soul is always beautiful--it appears more or it appears less--it         comes, or it lags behind,                                   170   It comes from its embower'd garden, and looks pleasantly on itself,         and encloses the world,   Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and         clean the womb cohering,   The head well-grown, proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and         joints proportion'd and plumb.   The Soul is always beautiful,   The universe is duly in order, everything is in its place,   What has arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place;   The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,   The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of         the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,   The sleepers that lived and died wait--the far advanced are to go on         in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their         turns,   The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite--         they unite now.                                             180   The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,   They flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from east to west, as         they lie unclothed,   The Asiatic and African are hand in hand--the European and American         are hand in hand,   Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand         in hand,   The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover--they         press close without lust--his lips press her neck,   The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with         measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with         measureless love,   The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the         daughter,   The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is         inarm'd by friend,   The scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses the scholar--         the wrong'd is made right,   The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master         salutes the slave,                                          190   The felon steps forth from the prison--the insane becomes sane--the         suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,   The sweatings and fevers stop--the throat that was unsound is sound--         the lungs of the consumptive are resumed--the poor distress'd         head is free,   The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother         than ever,   Stiflings and passages open--the paralyzed become supple,   The swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in         condition,   They pass the invigoration of the night, and the chemistry of the         night, and awake.   I too pass from the night,   I stay a while away, O night, but I return to you again, and love         you.   Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?   I am not afraid--I have been well brought forward by you; 200   I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so         long,   I know not how I came of you, and I know not where I go with you--but         I know I came well, and shall go well.   I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes;   I will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly return to you.                            THIS dust was once the Man,   Gentle, plain, just and resolute--under whose cautious hand,   Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age,   Was saved the Union of These States.                                                 OUT of the murk of heaviest clouds,   Out of the feudal wrecks, and heap'd-up skeletons of kings,   Out of that old entire European debris--the shatter'd mummeries,   Ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests,   Lo! Freedom's features, fresh, undimm'd, look forth--the same         immortal face looks forth;   (A glimpse as of thy mother's face, Columbia,   A flash significant as of a sword,   Beaming towards thee.)   Nor think we forget thee, Maternal;   Lag'd'st thou so long? Shall the clouds close again upon thee?     10   Ah, but thou hast Thyself now appear'd to us--we know thee;   Thou hast given us a sure proof, the glimpse of Thyself;   Thou waitest there, as everywhere, thy time.                                                 SOLID, ironical, rolling orb!    Master of all, and matter of fact! - at last I accept your terms;    Bringing to practical, vulgar tests, of all my ideal dreams,   And of me, as lover and hero.                                                 SPIRIT that form'd this scene,   These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,   These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,   These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,   These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,   I know thee, savage spirit--we have communed together,   Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;   Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art?   To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse?   The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's grace--column         and polish'd arch forgot?                                    10   But thou that revelest here--spirit that form'd this scene,   They have remember'd thee.                                                          POET.   O A new song, a free song,   Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,   By the wind's voice and that of the drum,   By the banner's voice, and child's voice, and sea's voice, and         father's voice,   Low on the ground and high in the air,   On the ground where father and child stand,   In the upward air where their eyes turn,   Where the banner at day-break is flapping.   Words! book-words! what are you?   Words no more, for hearken and see,                                10   My song is there in the open air--and I must sing,   With the banner and pennant a-flapping.   I'll weave the chord and twine in,   Man's desire and babe's desire--I'll twine them in, I'll put in life;   I'll put the bayonet's flashing point--I'll let bullets and slugs         whizz;   (As one carrying a symbol and menace, far into the future,   Crying with trumpet voice, Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!)   I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of         joy;   Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,   With the banner and pennant a-flapping.                            20                                PENNANT.   Come up here, bard, bard;   Come up here, soul, soul;   Come up here, dear little child,   To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless         light.                                 CHILD.   Father, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?   And what does it say to me all the while?                                FATHER.   Nothing, my babe, you see in the sky;   And nothing at all to you it says. But look you, my babe,   Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-         shops opening;   And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with         goods:                                                       10   These! ah, these! how valued and toil'd for, these!   How envied by all the earth!                                 POET.   Fresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high;   On floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its channels;   On floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in toward         land;   The great steady wind from west and west-by-south,   Floating so buoyant, with milk-white foam on the waters.   But I am not the sea, nor the red sun;   I am not the wind, with girlish laughter;   Not the immense wind which strengthens--not the wind which lashes; 20   Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death;   But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,   Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,   Which the birds know in the woods, mornings and evenings,   And the shore-sands know, and the hissing wave, and that banner and         pennant,   Aloft there flapping and flapping.                                 CHILD.   O father, it is alive--it is full of people--it has children!   O now it seems to me it is talking to its children!   I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!   O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast! O my father,          30   It is so broad, it covers the whole sky!                                FATHER.   Cease, cease, my foolish babe,   What you are saying is sorrowful to me--much it displeases me;   Behold with the rest, again I say--behold not banners and pennants         aloft;   But the well-prepared pavements behold--and mark the solid-wall'd         houses.                          BANNER AND PENNANT.   Speak to the child, O bard, out of Manhattan;   (The war is over--yet never over.... out of it, we are born to real         life and identity;)   Speak to our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,   Where our factory-engines hum, where our miners delve the ground,   Where our hoarse Niagara rumbles, where our prairie-plows are         plowing;                                                     40   Speak, O bard! point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--         and yet we know not why;   For what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,   Only flapping in the wind?                                 POET.   I hear and see not strips of cloth alone;   I hear again the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry;   I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men--I hear LIBERTY!   I hear the drums beat, and the trumpets yet blowing;   I myself move abroad, swift-rising, flying then;   I use the wings of the land-bird, and use the wings of the sea-bird,         and look down as from a height;   I do not deny the precious results of peace--I see populous cities,         with wealth incalculable;                                    50   I see numberless farms--I see the farmers working in their fields or         barns;   I see mechanics working--I see buildings everywhere founded, going         up, or finish'd;   I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks, drawn by         the locomotives;   I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New         Orleans;   I see far in the west the immense area of grain--I dwell awhile,         hovering;   I pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to the southern         plantation, and again to California;   Sweeping the whole, I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,         earned wages;   See the identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty         States (and many more to come;)   See forts on the shores of harbors--see ships sailing in and out;   Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant, shaped         like a sword,                                                60   Runs swiftly up, indicating war and defiance--And now the halyards         have rais'd it,   Side of my banner broad and blue--side of my starry banner,   Discarding peace over all the sea and land.                          BANNER AND PENNANT.   Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!   No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone;   We may be terror and carnage, and are so now;   Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor any         five, nor ten;)   Nor market nor depot are we, nor money-bank in the city;   But these, and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines         below, are ours;   And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers, great and         small;                                                       70   And the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops and the fruits         are ours;   Bays and channels, and ships sailing in and out, are ours--and we         over all,   Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square         miles--the capitals,   The forty millions of people--O bard! in life and death supreme,   We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,   Not for the present alone, for a thousand years, chanting through         you,   This song to the soul of one poor little child.                                CHILD.   O my father, I like not the houses;   They will never to me be anything--nor do I like money;   But to mount up there I would like, O father dear--that banner I         like;                                                        80   That pennant I would be, and must be.                               FATHER.   Child of mine, you fill me with anguish;   To be that pennant would be too fearful;   Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever;   It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything;   Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you         to do with them?   With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?                                POET.   Demons and death then I sing;   Put in all, aye all, will I--sword-shaped pennant for war, and banner         so broad and blue,   And a pleasure new and extatic, and the prattled yearning of         children,                                                    90   Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the liquid wash of         the sea;   And the black ships, fighting on the sea, enveloped in smoke;   And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and         pines;   And the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the         hot sun shining south;   And the beech-waves combing over the beach on my eastern shore, and         my western shore the same;   And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi, with         bends and chutes;   And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of         Missouri;   The CONTINENT--devoting the whole identity, without reserving an         atom,   Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all, and the yield         of all.                          BANNER AND PENNANT.   Aye all! for ever, for all!                                       100   From sea to sea, north and south, east and west,   (The war is completed, the price is paid, the title is settled beyond         recall;)   Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole;   No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,   But, out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no         more,   Croaking like crows here in the wind.                                POET.                              (Finale.)   My limbs, my veins dilate;   The blood of the world has fill'd me full--my theme is clear at last:   --Banner so broad, advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and         resolute;   I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and         blinded;                                                    110   My sight, my hearing and tongue, are come to me, (a little child         taught me;)   I hear from above, O pennant of war, your ironical call and demand;   Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!   Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity,         (if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses to         destroy them;   You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full         of comfort, built with money;   May they stand fast, then? Not an hour, except you, above them and         all, stand fast;)   --O banner! not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor         the material good nutriment,   Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships;   Not the superb ships, with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and         carrying cargoes,   Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,--But you, as henceforth         I see you,                                                  120   Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, (ever-         enlarging stars;)   Divider of day-break you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,         measuring the sky,   (Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,   While others remain busy, or smartly talking, forever teaching         thrift, thrift;)   O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake, hissing         so curious,   Out of reach--an idea only--yet furiously fought for, risking bloody         death--loved by me!   So loved! O you banner leading the day, with stars brought from the         night!   Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute         owner of ALL)--O banner and pennant!   I too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines         are nothing--I see them not;   I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I         sing you only,                                              130   Flapping up there in the wind.                            LO! THE unbounded sea!   On its breast a Ship starting, spreading all her sails--an ample         Ship, carrying even her moonsails;   The pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds so stately--         below, emulous waves press forward,   They surround the Ship, with shining curving motions, and foam.                            THE indications, and tally of time;   Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs;   Time, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts;   What always indicates the poet, is the crowd of the pleasant company         of singers, and their words;   The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or         dark--but the words of the maker of poems are the general light         and dark;   The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,   His insight and power encircle things and the human race,   He is the glory and extract thus far, of things, and of the human         race.   The singers do not beget--only the POET begets;   The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough--but rare         has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker         of poems, the Answerer,                                      10   (Not every century, or every five centuries, has contain'd such a         day, for all its names.)   The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible         names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,   The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer, sweet-         singer, echo-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer, or something         else.   All this time, and at all times, wait the words of true poems;   The words of true poems do not merely please,   The true poets are not followers of beauty, but the august masters of         beauty;   The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and         fathers,   The words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science.   Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,         rudeness of body, withdrawnness,   Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness--such are some of the words of         poems.                                                       20   The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the answerer;   The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist--all         these underlie the maker of poems, the answerer.   The words of the true poems give you more than poems,   They give you to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war,         peace, behavior, histories, essays, romances, and everything         else,   They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,   They do not seek beauty--they are sought,   Forever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing,         fain, love-sick.   They prepare for death--yet are they not the finish, but rather the         outset,   They bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full;   Whom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars,         to learn one of the meanings,                                30   To launch off with absolute faith--to sweep through the ceaseless         rings, and never be quiet again.                            SCENTED herbage of my breast,   Leaves from you I yield, I write, to be perused best afterwards,   Tomb-leaves, body-leaves, growing up above me, above death,   Perennial roots, tall leaves--O the winter shall not freeze you,         delicate leaves,   Every year shall you bloom again--out from where you retired, you         shall emerge again;   O I do not know whether many, passing by, will discover you, or         inhale your faint odor--but I believe a few will;   O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell, in         your own way, of the heart that is under you;   O burning and throbbing--surely all will one day be accomplish'd;   O I do not know what you mean, there underneath yourselves--you are         not happiness,   You are often more bitter than I can bear--you burn and sting me,  10   Yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged roots--you make me         think of Death,   Death is beautiful from you--(what indeed is finally beautiful,         except Death and Love?)   --O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of         lovers--I think it must be for Death,   For how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the atmosphere of         lovers,   Death or life I am then indifferent--my Soul declines to prefer,   I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes death most;   Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as         you mean;   Grow up taller, sweet leaves, that I may see! grow up out of my         breast!   Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!   Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots, timid leaves!   20   Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!   Come, I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine--I have         long enough stifled and choked:   --Emblematic and capricious blade, I leave you--now you serve me not;   Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself,   I will escape from the sham that was proposed to me,   I will sound myself and comrades only--I will never again utter a         call, only their call,   I will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through The States,   I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent shape and will         through The States;   Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating;   Give me your tone therefore, O Death, that I may accord with it,   30   Give me yourself--for I see that you belong to me now above all, and         are folded inseparably together--you Love and Death are;   Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling         life,   For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,   That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons--and that         they are mainly for you,   That you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the real reality,   That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how         long,   That you will one day, perhaps, take control of all,   That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,   That may-be you are what it is all for--but it does not last so very         long;   But you will last very long.                                       40                                                 SMALL is the theme of the following Chant, yet the greatest--namely,         One's-Self--that wondrous thing a simple, separate person.         That, for the use of the New World, I sing.   Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy         alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse;--I say the Form         complete is worthier far. The female equal with the male, I         sing,   Nor cease at the theme of One's-Self. I speak the word of the modern,         the word En-Masse:   My Days I sing, and the Lands--with interstice I knew of hapless War.   O friend whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I feel         through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I return.         And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.                            NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only;   Not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;   Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs;   Not in many an oath and promise broken;   Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition;   Not in the subtle nourishment of the air;   Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists;   Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day         cease;   Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;   Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in         the wilds;                                                   10   Not in husky pantings through clench'd teeth;   Not in sounded and resounded words--chattering words, echoes, dead         words;   Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,   Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day;   Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you         continually--Not there;   Not in any or all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!   Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these         songs.                            WHEN I peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes, and the victories of         mighty generals, I do not envy the generals,   Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house;   But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,   How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long,   Through youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how         affectionate and faithful they were,   Then I am pensive--I hastily walk away, fill'd with the bitterest         envy.                            THITHER, as I look, I see each result and glory retracing itself and         nestling close, always obligated;   Thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,         establishments, even the most minute;   Thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;   Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,   As a father, to his father going, takes his children along with him.                            GIVE me your hand, old Revolutionary;   The hill-top is nigh--but a few steps, (make room, gentlemen;)   Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and         extra years;   You can walk, old man, though your eyes are almost done;   Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.   Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means;   On the plain below, recruits are drilling and exercising;   There is the camp--one regiment departs to-morrow;   Do you hear the officers giving the orders?   Do you hear the clank of the muskets?                              10   Why, what comes over you now, old man?   Why do you tremble, and clutch my hand so convulsively?   The troops are but drilling--they are yet surrounded with smiles;   Around them, at hand, the well-drest friends, and the women;   While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down;   Green the midsummer verdure, and fresh blows the dallying breeze,   O'er proud and peaceful cities, and arm of the sea between.   But drill and parade are over--they march back to quarters;   Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!   As wending, the crowds now part and disperse--but we, old man,     20   Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain;   You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.                            THE CENTENARIAN.   When I clutch'd your hand, it was not with terror;   But suddenly, pouring about me here, on every side,   And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they         ran,   And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see, south and south-         east and south-west,   Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,   And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over), came again, and         suddenly raged,   As eighty-five years agone, no mere parade receiv'd with applause of         friends,   But a battle, which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I         took part in it,                                             30   Walking then this hill-top, this same ground.   Aye, this is the ground;   My blind eyes, even as I speak, behold it re-peopled from graves;   The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear;   Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted;   I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay;   I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes:   Here we lay encamp'd--it was this time in summer also.   As I talk, I remember all--I remember the Declaration;   It was read here--the whole army paraded--it was read to us here;  40   By his staff surrounded, the General stood in the middle--he held up         his unsheath'd sword,   It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.   'Twas a bold act then;   The English war-ships had just arrived--the king had sent them from         over the sea;   We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,   And the transports, swarming with soldiers.   A few days more, and they landed--and then the battle.   Twenty thousand were brought against us,   A veteran force, furnish'd with good artillery.   I tell not now the whole of the battle;                            50   But one brigade, early in the forenoon, order'd forward to engage the         red-coats;   Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,   And how long and how well it stood, confronting death.   Who do you think that was, marching steadily, sternly confronting         death?   It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,   Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and many of them known personally to         the General.   Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters;   Till of a sudden, unlook'd for, by defiles through the woods, gain'd         at night,   The British advancing, wedging in from the east, fiercely playing         their guns,   That brigade of the youngest was cut off, and at the enemy's         mercy.                                                       60   The General watch'd them from this hill;   They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment;   Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the         middle;   But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!   It sickens me yet, that slaughter!   I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General;   I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.   Meanwhile the British maneuver'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle;   But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.   We fought the fight in detachments;                                70   Sallying forth, we fought at several points--but in each the luck was         against us;   Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to         the works on this hill;   Till we turn'd, menacing, here, and then he left us.   That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two         thousand strong;   Few return'd--nearly all remain in Brooklyn.   That, and here, my General's first battle;   No women looking on, nor sunshine to bask in--it did not conclude         with applause;   Nobody clapp'd hands here then.   But in darkness, in mist, on the ground, under a chill rain,   Wearied that night we lay, foil'd and sullen;                      80   While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord, off against us         encamp'd,   Quite within hearing, feasting, klinking wine-glasses together over         their victory.   So, dull and damp, and another day;   But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,   Silent as a ghost, while they thought they were sure of him, my         General retreated.   I saw him at the river-side,   Down by the ferry, lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;   My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over;   And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the         last time.   Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom;                           90   Many no doubt thought of capitulation.   But when my General pass'd me,   As he stood in his boat, and look'd toward the coming sun,   I saw something different from capitulation.                               TERMINUS.   Enough--the Centenarian's story ends;   The two, the past and present, have interchanged;   I myself, as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now         speaking.   And is this the ground Washington trod?   And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he         cross'd,   As resolute in defeat, as other generals in their proudest         triumphs?                                                   100   It is well--a lesson like that, always comes good;   I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward;   I must preserve that look, as it beam'd on you, rivers of Brooklyn.   See! as the annual round returns, the phantoms return;   It is the 27th of August, and the British have landed;   The battle begins, and goes against us--behold! through the smoke,         Washington's face;   The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept         the enemy;   They are cut off--murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them;   Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,   Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds, 110   In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.   Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable         than your owners supposed;   Ah, river! henceforth you will be illumin'd to me at sunrise with         something besides the sun.   Encampments new! in the midst of you stands an encampment very old;   Stands forever the camp of the dead brigade.                            RECORDERS ages hence!   Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior--I will         tell you what to say of me;   Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest         lover,   The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was         fondest,   Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love         within him--and freely pour'd it forth,   Who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his         lovers,   Who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleepless and         dissatisfied at night,   Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might         secretly be indifferent to him,   Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on         hills, he and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain,         apart from other men,   Who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curv'd with his arm the shoulder         of his friend--while the arm of his friend rested upon him         also.                                                        10                                                 STATES!   Were you looking to be held together by the lawyers?   By an agreement on a paper? Or by arms?   Away!   I arrive, bringing these, beyond all the forces of courts and arms,   These! to hold you together as firmly as the earth itself is held         together.   The old breath of life, ever new,   Here! I pass it by contact to you, America.   O mother! have you done much for me?   Behold, there shall from me be much done for you.                  10   There shall from me be a new friendship--It shall be called after my         name,   It shall circulate through The States, indifferent of place,   It shall twist and intertwist them through and around each other--         Compact shall they be, showing new signs,   Affection shall solve every one of the problems of freedom,   Those who love each other shall be invincible,   They shall finally make America completely victorious, in my name.   One from Massachusetts shall be comrade to a Missourian,   One from Maine or Vermont, and a Carolinian and an Oregonese, shall         be friends triune, more precious to each other than all the         riches of the earth.   To Michigan shall be wafted perfume from Florida,   To the Mannahatta from Cuba or Mexico,                             20   Not the perfume of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.   No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,   If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one,   The Kanuck shall be willing to lay down his life for the Kansian, and         the Kansian for the Kanuck, on due need.   It shall be customary in all directions, in the houses and streets,         to see manly affection,   The departing brother or friend shall salute the remaining brother or         friend with a kiss.   There shall be innovations,   There shall be countless linked hands--namely, the Northeasterner's,         and the Northwesterner's, and the Southwesterner's, and those         of the interior, and all their brood,   These shall be masters of the world under a new power,   They shall laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the         world.                                                       30   The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,   The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,   The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.   These shall tie and band stronger than hoops of iron,   I, extatic, O partners! O lands! henceforth with the love of lovers         tie you.                            NOW list to my morning's romanza--I tell the signs of the Answerer;   To the cities and farms I sing, as they spread in the sunshine before         me.   A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother;   How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?   Tell him to send me the signs.   And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his right         hand in my left hand, and his left hand in my right hand,   And I answer for his brother, and for men, and I answer for him that         answers for all, and send these signs.   Him all wait for--him all yield up to--his word is decisive and         final,   Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, as amid         light,   Him they immerse, and he immerses them.                            10   Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people,         animals,   The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean, (so         tell I my morning's romanza;)   All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will         buy,   The best farms--others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably         reaps,   The noblest and costliest cities--others grading and building, and he         domiciles there;   Nothing for any one, but what is for him--near and far are for him,         the ships in the offing,   The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if they are for         any body.   He puts things in their attitudes;   He puts to-day out of himself, with plasticity and love;   He places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and         sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest         never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.      20   He is the answerer:   What can be answer'd he answers--and what cannot be answer'd, he         shows how it cannot be answer'd.   A man is a summons and challenge;   (It is vain to skulk--Do you hear that mocking and laughter? Do you         hear the ironical echoes?)   Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,         beat up and down, seeking to give satisfaction;   He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and         down also.   Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly         and gently and safely, by day or by night;   He has the pass-key of hearts--to him the response of the prying of         hands on the knobs.   His welcome is universal--the flow of beauty is not more welcome or         universal than he is;   The person he favors by day, or sleeps with at night, is blessed. 30   Every existence has its idiom--everything has an idiom and tongue;   He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and         any man translates, and any man translates himself also;   One part does not counteract another part--he is the joiner--he sees         how they join.   He says indifferently and alike, How are you, friend? to the         President at his levee,   And he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-         field,   And both understand him, and know that his speech is right.   He walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,   He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,         Here is our equal, appearing and new.   Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,   And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he         has follow'd the sea,                                        40   And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an         artist,   And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them;   No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has         follow'd it,   No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and         sisters there.   The English believe he comes of their English stock,   A Jew to the Jew he seems--a Russ to the Russ--usual and near,         removed from none.   Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,   The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the         Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is sure;   The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the         Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or Sacramento, or Hudson, or         Paumanok Sound, claims him.   The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood;     50   The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see         themselves in the ways of him--he strangely transmutes them,   They are not vile any more--they hardly know themselves, they are so         grown.                            A GREAT year and place;   A harsh, discordant, natal scream out-sounding, to touch the mother's         heart closer than any yet.   I walk'd the shores of my Eastern Sea,   Heard over the waves the little voice,   Saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the         roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings;   Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running--nor from the         single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the         tumbrils;   Was not so desperate at the battues of death--was not so shock'd at         the repeated fusillades of the guns.   Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued         retribution?   Could I wish humanity different?   Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?                    10   Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?   O Liberty! O mate for me!   Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve, to fetch         them out in case of need;   Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd;   Here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic;   Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.   Hence I sign this salute over the sea,   And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,   But remember the little voice that I heard wailing--and wait with         perfect trust, no matter how long;   And from to-day, sad and cogent, I maintain the bequeath'd cause, as         for all lands,                                               20   And I send these words to Paris with my love,   And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,   For I guess there is latent music yet in France--floods of it;   O I hear already the bustle of instruments--they will soon be         drowning all that would interrupt them;   O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,   It reaches hither--it swells me to joyful madness,   I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,   I will yet sing a song for you, MA FEMME.                            RACE of veterans! Race of victors!   Race of the soil, ready for conflict! race of the conquering march!   (No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race;)   Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself;   Race of passion and the storm.                            NOT youth pertains to me,   Nor delicatesse--I cannot beguile the time with talk;   Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant;   In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still--for learning.         inures not to me;   Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me--yet there are two or three things         inure to me;   I have nourish'd the wounded, and sooth'd many a dying soldier,   And at intervals, waiting, or in the midst of camp,   Composed these songs.                            STILL, though the one I sing,   (One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,   I leave in him Revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O quenchless,         indispensable fire!)                                                 IN a faraway northern county, in the placid, pastoral region,   Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous Tamer of         Oxen:   There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds, to         break them;   He will take the wildest steer in the world, and break him and tame         him;   He will go, fearless, without any whip, where the young bullock         chafes up and down the yard;   The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air, with raging eyes;   Yet, see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this Tamer tames         him:   See you! on the farms hereabout, a hundred oxen, young and old--and         he is the man who has tamed them;   They all know him--all are affectionate to him;   See you! some are such beautiful animals--so lofty looking!        10   Some are buff color'd--some mottled--one has a white line running         along his back--some are brindled,   Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--See you! the bright         hides;   See, the two with stars on their foreheads--See, the round bodies and         broad backs;   See, how straight and square they stand on their legs--See, what         fine, sagacious eyes;   See, how they watch their Tamer--they wish him near them--how they         turn to look after him!   What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from         them:   --Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,         poems depart--all else departs;)   I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend,   Whom a hundred oxen love, there in his life on farms,   In the northern county far, in the placid, pastoral region.                                                 SHUT not your doors to me, proud libraries,   For that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, yet         needed most, I bring;   Forth from the army, the war emerging--a book I have made,   The words of my book nothing--the drift of it everything;   A book separate, not link'd with the rest, nor felt by the intellect,   But you, ye untold latencies, will thrill to every page;   Through Space and Time fused in a chant, and the flowing, eternal         Identity,   To Nature, encompassing these, encompassing God--to the joyous,         electric All,   To the sense of Death--and accepting, exulting in Death, in its turn,         the same as life,   The entrance of Man I sing.                                        10                                                 WILD, wild the storm, and the sea high running,   Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering,   Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,   Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,   Out in the shadows there milk-white combs careering,   On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting,   Where through the murk the easterly death-wind breasting,   Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing,   (That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)   Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending,        10   Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,   Along the midnight edge by those milk-white combs careering,   A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,   That savage trinity warily watching.                            FROM Paumanock starting, I fly like a bird,   Around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all;   To the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,   To Kanada, till I absorb Kanada in myself--to Michigan then,   To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are         inimitable;)   Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs--to Missouri and Kansas and         Arkansas, to sing theirs,   To Tennessee and Kentucky--to the Carolinas and Georgia, to sing         theirs,   To Texas, and so along up toward California, to roam accepted         everywhere;   To sing first, (to the tap of the war-drum, if need be,)   The idea of all--of the western world, one and inseparable.        10   And then the song of each member of These States.                            LONG, too long, O land,   Traveling roads all even and peaceful, you learn'd from joys and         prosperity only;   But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish--advancing,         grappling with direst fate, and recoiling not;   And now to conceive, and show to the world, what your children         en-masse really are;   (For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse         really are?)                                                 O BITTER sprig! Confession sprig!   In the bouquet I give you place also--I bind you in,   Proceeding no further till, humbled publicly,   I give fair warning, once for all.   I own that I have been sly, thievish, mean, a prevaricator, greedy,         derelict,   And I own that I remain so yet.   What foul thought but I think it--or have in me the stuff out of         which it is thought?   What in darkness in bed at night, alone or with a companion?                                                 NOT my enemies ever invade me--no harm to my pride from them I fear;   But the lovers I recklessly love--lo! how they master me!   Lo! me, ever open and helpless, bereft of my strength!   Utterly abject, grovelling on the ground before them.                                                 FROM far Dakota's cañons,   Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky Sioux, the lonesome stretch, the         silence,   Haply to-day a mournful wail, haply a trumpet-note for heroes.   The battle-bulletin,   The Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,   The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,   In the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses         for breastworks,   The fall of Custer and all his officers and men.   Continues yet the old, old legend of our race,   The loftiest of life upheld by death,                              10   The ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,   O lesson opportune, O how I welcome thee!   As sitting in dark days,   Lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for light,         for hope,   From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof,   (The sun there at the centre though conceal'd,   Electric life forever at the centre,)   Breaks forth a lightning flash.   Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,   I erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a         bright sword in thy hand,                                    20   Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds,   (I bring no dirge for it or thee, I bring a glad triumphal sonnet,)   Desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,   After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color   Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,   Thou yieldest up thyself.                            LOCATIONS and times--what is it in me that meets them all, whenever         and wherever, and makes me at home?   Forms, colors, densities, odors--what is it in me that corresponds         with them?                            THEY shall arise in the States,   They shall report Nature, laws, physiology, and happiness;   They shall illustrate Democracy and the kosmos;   They shall be alimentive, amative, perceptive;   They shall be complete women and men--their pose brawny and supple,         their drink water, their blood clean and clear;   They shall enjoy materialism and the sight of products--they shall         enjoy the sight of the beef, lumber, bread-stuffs, of Chicago,         the great city;   They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and         oratresses;   Strong and sweet shall their tongues be--poems and materials of poems         shall come from their lives--they shall be makers and finders;   Of them, and of their works, shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey         gospels;   Characters, events, retrospections, shall be convey'd in gospels   --Trees, animals, waters, shall be convey'd,                       10   Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all be convey'd.                            OTHERS may praise what they like;   But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing, in         art, or aught else,   Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river--also the         western prairie-scent,   And fully exudes it again.                                                 IT was near the close of his indomitable and pious life--on his last voyagewhen nearly 70 years of age--that Columbus, to save his two remaining shipsfrom foundering in the Caribbean Sea in a terrible storm, had to run themashore on the Island of Jamaica--where, laid up for a long and miserableyear--1503--he was taken very sick, had several relapses, his men revolted,and death seem'd daily imminent; though he was eventually rescued, and senthome to Spain to die, unrecognized, neglected and in want......It is onlyask'd, as preparation and atmosphere for the following lines, that the bareauthentic facts be recall'd and realized, and nothing contributed by thefancy. See, the Antillean Island, with its florid skies and rich foliageand scenery, the waves beating the solitary sands, and the hulls of theships in the distance. See, the figure of the great Admiral, walking thebeach, as a stage, in this sublimest tragedy--for what tragedy, what poem,so piteous and majestic as the real scene?--and hear him uttering--as hismystical and religious soul surely utter'd, the ideas following--perhaps,in their equivalents, the very words.   A BATTER'D, wreck'd old man,   Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,   Pent by the sea, and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,   Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd, and nigh to death,   I take my way along the island's edge,   Venting a heavy heart.   I am too full of woe!   Haply, I may not live another day;   I can not rest, O God--I can not eat or drink or sleep,   Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,             10   Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee--commune with Thee,   Report myself once more to Thee.   Thou knowest my years entire, my life,   (My long and crowded life of active work--not adoration merely;)   Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth;   Thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary meditations;   Thou knowest how, before I commenced, I devoted all to come to Thee;   Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows, and strictly kept         them;   Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee;   (In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,                 20   Accepting all from Thee--as duly come from Thee.)   All my emprises have been fill'd with Thee,   My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,   Sailing the deep, or journeying the land for Thee;   Intentions, purports, aspirations mine--leaving results to Thee.   O I am sure they really come from Thee!   The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,   The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,   A message from the Heavens, whispering to me even in sleep,   These sped me on.                                                  30   By me, and these, the work so far accomplish'd (for what has been,         has been;)   By me Earth's elder, cloy'd and stifled lands, uncloy'd, unloos'd;   By me the hemispheres rounded and tied--the unknown to the known.   The end I know not--it is all in Thee;   Or small, or great, I know not--haply, what broad fields, what lands;   Haply, the brutish, measureless human undergrowth I know,   Transplanted there, may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee;   Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn'd to reaping-tools;   Haply the lifeless cross I know--Europe's dead cross--may bud and         blossom there.   One effort more--my altar this bleak sand:                         40   That Thou, O God, my life hast lighted,   With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,   (Light rare, untellable--lighting the very light!   Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages!)   For that, O God--be it my latest word--here on my knees,   Old, poor, and paralyzed--I thank Thee.   My terminus near,   The clouds already closing in upon me,   The voyage balk'd--the course disputed, lost,   I yield my ships to Thee.                                          50   Steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are Thine;   Take Thou command--(what to my petty skill Thy navigation?)   My hands, my limbs grow nerveless;   My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd; Let the old timbers part--I will         not part!   I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me;   Thee, Thee, at least, I know.   Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?   What do I know of life? what of myself?   I know not even my own work, past or present;                      60   Dim, ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,   Of newer, better worlds, their mighty parturition,   Mocking, perplexing me.   And these things I see suddenly--what mean they?   As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,   Shadowy, vast shapes, smile through the air and sky,   And on the distant waves sail countless ships,   And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.                            DELICATE cluster! flag of teeming life!   Covering all my lands! all my sea-shores lining!   Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle         pressing!   How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)   Flag cerulean! sunny flag! with the orbs of night dappled!   Ah my silvery beauty! ah my woolly white and crimson!   Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!   My sacred one, my mother.                            OVER the carnage rose prophetic a voice,   Be not dishearten'd--Affection shall solve the problems of Freedom         yet;   Those who love each other shall become invincible--they shall yet         make Columbia victorious.   Sons of the Mother of All! you shall yet be victorious!   You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the         earth.   No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers;   If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.   One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade;   From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another, an Oregonese, shall be         friends triune,   More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.      10   To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come;   Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.   It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly         affection;   The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly;   The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,   The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.   These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron;   I, extatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.   (Were you looking to be held together by the lawyers?   Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?                         20   --Nay--nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)                            AFTER all, not to create only, or found only,   But to bring, perhaps from afar, what is already founded,   To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free;   To fill the gross, the torpid bulk with vital religious fire;   Not to repel or destroy, so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate;   To obey, as well as command--to follow, more than to lead;   These also are the lessons of our New World;   --While how little the New, after all--how much the Old, Old World!   Long, long, long, has the grass been growing,   Long and long has the rain been falling,                           10   Long has the globe been rolling round.   Come, Muse, migrate from Greece and Ionia;   Cross out, please, those immensely overpaid accounts,   That matter of Troy, and Achilles' wrath, and Eneas', Odysseus'         wanderings;   Placard "Removed" and "To Let" on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus;   Repeat at Jerusalem--place the notice high on Jaffa's gate, and on         Mount Moriah;   The same on the walls of your Gothic European Cathedrals, and German,         French and Spanish Castles;   For know a better, fresher, busier sphere--a wide, untried domain         awaits, demands you.   Responsive to our summons,   Or rather to her long-nurs'd inclination,                          20   Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,   She comes! this famous Female--as was indeed to be expected;   (For who, so-ever youthful, 'cute and handsome, would wish to stay in         mansions such as those,   When offer'd quarters with all the modern improvements,   With all the fun that 's going--and all the best society?)   She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown;   I scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance;   I mark her step divine--her curious eyes a-turning, rolling,   Upon this very scene.   The Dame of Dames! can I believe, then,                            30   Those ancient temples classic, and castles strong and feudalistic,   could none of them restrain her?   Nor shades of Virgil and Dante--nor myriad memories, poems, old         associations, magnetize and hold on to her?   But that she 's left them all--and here?   Yes, if you will allow me to say so,   I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see Her,   The same Undying Soul of Earth's, activity's, beauty's, heroism's         Expression,   Out from her evolutions hither come--submerged the strata of her         former themes,   Hidden and cover'd by to-day's--foundation of to-day's;   Ended, deceas'd, through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain;   Silent through time the broken-lipp'd Sphynx in Egypt--silent those         century-baffling tombs;                                      40   Closed for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors;   Calliope's call for ever closed--Clio, Melpomene, Thalia closed and         dead;   Seal'd the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana--ended the quest of the         Holy Graal;   Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind--extinct;   The Crusaders' streams of shadowy, midnight troops, sped with the         sunrise;   Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone--Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone,   Palmerin, ogre, departed--vanish'd the turrets that Usk reflected,   Arthur vanish'd with all his knights--Merlin and Lancelot and         Galahad--all gone--dissolv'd utterly, like an exhalation;   Pass'd! pass'd! for us, for ever pass'd! that once so mighty World--         now void, inanimate, phantom World!   Embroider'd, dazzling World! with all its gorgeous legends, myths, 50   Its kings and barons proud--its priests, and warlike lords, and         courtly dames;   Pass'd to its charnel vault--laid on the shelf--coffin'd, with Crown         and Armor on,   Blazon'd with Shakspeare's purple page,   And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.   I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the Animus of all that World,   Escaped, bequeath'd, vital, fugacious as ever, leaving those dead         remains, and now this spot approaching, filling;   --And I can hear what maybe you do not--a terrible aesthetical         commotion,   With howling, desperate gulp of "flower" and "bower,"   With "Sonnet to Matilda's Eyebrow" quite, quite frantic;   With gushing, sentimental reading circles turn'd to ice or stone;  60   With many a squeak, (in metre choice,) from Boston, New York,         Philadelphia, London;   As she, the illustrious Emigré, (having, it is true, in her day,         although the same, changed, journey'd considerable,)   Making directly for this rendezvous--vigorously clearing a path for         herself--striding through the confusion,   By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,   Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,   Smiling and pleased, with palpable intent to stay,   She 's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!   But hold--don't I forget my manners?   To introduce the Stranger (what else indeed have I come for?) to         thee, Columbia:   In Liberty's name, welcome, Immortal! clasp hands,                 70   And ever henceforth Sisters dear be both.   Fear not, O Muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you,   (I candidly confess, a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,)   And yet the same old human race--the same within, without,   Faces and hearts the same--feelings the same--yearnings the same,   The same old love--beauty and use the same.   We do not blame thee, Elder World--nor separate ourselves from thee:   (Would the Son separate himself from the Father?)   Looking back on thee--seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs, through         past ages bending, building,   We build to ours to-day.                                           80   Mightier than Egypt's tombs,   Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples,   Prouder than Milan's statued, spired Cathedral,   More picturesque than Rhenish castle-keeps,   We plan, even now, to raise, beyond them all,   Thy great Cathedral, sacred Industry--no tomb,   A Keep for life for practical Invention.   As in a waking vision,   E'en while I chant, I see it rise--I scan and prophesy outside and         in,   Its manifold ensemble.                                             90   Around a Palace,   Loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,   Earth's modern Wonder, History's Seven outstripping,   High rising tier on tier, with glass and iron façades.   Gladdening the sun and sky--enhued in cheerfulest hues,   Bronze, lilac, robin's-egg, marine and crimson,   Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner, Freedom,   The banners of The States, the flags of every land,   A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser Palaces shall cluster.   Somewhere within the walls of all,                                100   Shall all that forwards perfect human life be started,   Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.   Here shall you trace in flowing operation,   In every state of practical, busy movement,   The rills of Civilization.   Materials here, under your eye, shall change their shape, as if by         magic;   The cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field,   Shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread and cloth,         before you:   You shall see hands at work at all the old processes, and all the new         ones;   You shall see the various grains, and how flour is made, and then         bread baked by the bakers;                                  110   You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and         on till they become bullion;   You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a composing         stick is;   You shall mark, in amazement, the Hoe press whirling its cylinders,         shedding the printed leaves steady and fast:   The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before you.   In large calm halls, a stately Museum shall teach you the infinite,         solemn lessons of Minerals;   In another, woods, plants, Vegetation shall be illustrated--in         another Animals, animal life and development.   One stately house shall be the Music House;   Others for other Arts--Learning, the Sciences, shall all be here;   None shall be slighted--none but shall here be honor'd, help'd,         exampled.   This, this and these, America, shall be your Pyramids and         Obelisks,                                                   120   Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon,   Your temple at Olympia.   The male and female many laboring not,   Shall ever here confront the laboring many,   With precious benefits to both--glory to all,   To thee, America--and thee, Eternal Muse.   And here shall ye inhabit, Powerful Matrons!   In your vast state, vaster than all the old;   Echoed through long, long centuries to come,   To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes,       130   Practical, peaceful life--the people's life--the People themselves,   Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace--elate, secure in peace.   Away with themes of war! away with War itself!   Hence from my shuddering sight, to never more return, that show of         blacken'd, mutilated corpses!   That hell unpent, and raid of blood--fit for wild tigers, or for lop-         tongued wolves--not reasoning men!   And in its stead speed Industry's campaigns!   With thy undaunted armies, Engineering!   Thy pennants, Labor, loosen'd to the breeze!   Thy bugles sounding loud and clear!   Away with old romance!                                            140   Away with novels, plots, and plays of foreign courts!   Away with love-verses, sugar'd in rhyme--the intrigues, amours of         idlers,   Fitted for only banquets of the night, where dancers to late music         slide;   The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few,   With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.   To you, ye Reverent, sane Sisters,   To this resplendent day, the present scene,   These eyes and ears that like some broad parterre bloom up around,         before me,   I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for Art,   To exalt the present and the real,                                150   To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,   To sing, in songs, how exercise and chemical life are never to be         baffled;   Boldly to thee, America, to-day! and thee, Immortal Muse!   To practical, manual work, for each and all--to plough, hoe, dig,   To plant and tend the tree, the berry, the vegetables, flowers,   For every man to see to it that he really do something--for every         woman too;   To use the hammer, and the saw, (rip or cross-cut,)   To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,   To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,   To invent a little--something ingenious--to aid the washing, cooking,         cleaning,                                                   160   And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.   I say I bring thee, Muse, to-day and here,   All occupations, duties broad and close,   Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,   The old, old general burdens, interests, joys,   The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,   The house-comforts--the house itself, and all its belongings,   Food and its preservations--chemistry applied to it;   Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet-blooded Man or         Woman--the perfect, longeve Personality,   And helps its present life to health and happiness--and shapes its         Soul,                                                       170   For the eternal Real Life to come.   With latest materials, works,   Steam-power, the great Express lines, gas, petroleum,   These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,   The Pacific Railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis tunnel;   Science advanced, in grandeur and reality, analyzing every thing,   This world all spann'd with iron rails--with lines of steamships   threading every sea,   Our own Rondure, the current globe I bring.   And thou, high-towering One--America!   Thy swarm of offspring towering high--yet higher thee, above all         towering,                                                   180   With Victory on thy left, and at thy right hand Law;   Thou Union, holding all--fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,   Thee, ever thee, I bring.   Thou--also thou, a world!   With all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant,   Rounding by thee in One--one common orbic language,   One common indivisible destiny and Union.   And by the spells which ye vouchsafe,   To those, your ministers in earnest,   I here personify and call my themes,                              190   To make them pass before ye.   Behold, America! (And thou, ineffable Guest and Sister!)   For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands:   Behold! thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains,   As in procession coming.   Behold! the sea itself!   And on its limitless, heaving breast, thy ships:   See! where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the green         and blue!   See! thy steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port!   See! dusky and undulating, their long pennants of smoke!          200   Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,   Or in Maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful axemen,   Wielding all day their axes!   Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels--thy oarsmen!   Behold how the ash writhes under those muscular arms!   There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,   Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths, swinging their sledges;   Overhand so steady--overhand they turn and fall, with joyous clank,   Like a tumult of laughter.   Behold! (for still the procession moves,)                         210   Behold, Mother of All, thy countless sailors, boatmen, coasters!   The myriads of thy young and old mechanics!   Mark--mark the spirit of invention everywhere--thy rapid patents,   Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising;   See, from their chimneys, how the tall flame-fires stream!   Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,   Thy wealthy Daughter-States, Eastern, and Western,   The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia, Texas,         and the rest;   Thy limitless crops--grass, wheat, sugar, corn, rice, hemp, hops,   Thy barns all fill'd--thy endless freight-trains, and thy bulging         store-houses,                                               220   The grapes that ripen on thy vines--the apples in thy orchards,   Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes--thy coal--thy gold and         silver,   The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.   All thine, O sacred Union!   Ship, farm, shop, barns, factories, mines,   City and State--North, South, item and aggregate,   We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!   Protectress absolute, thou! Bulwark of all!   For well we know that while thou givest each and all, (generous as         God,)   Without thee, neither all nor each, nor land, home,               230   Ship, nor mine--nor any here, this day, secure,   Nor aught, nor any day secure.   And thou, thy Emblem, waving over all!   Delicate beauty! a word to thee, (it may be salutary;)   Remember, thou hast not always been, as here to-day, so comfortably         ensovereign'd;   In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee, flag;   Not quite so trim and whole, and freshly blooming, in folds of         stainless silk;   But I have seen thee, bunting, to tatters torn, upon thy splinter'd         staff,   Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's breast, with desperate         hands,   Savagely struggled for, for life or death--fought over long,      240   'Mid cannon's thunder-crash, and many a curse, and groan and yell--         and rifle-volleys cracking sharp,   And moving masses, as wild demons surging--and lives as nothing         risk'd,   For thy mere remnant, grimed with dirt and smoke, and sopp'd in         blood;   For sake of that, my beauty--and that thou might'st dally, as now,         secure up there,   Many a good man have I seen go under.   Now here, and these, and hence, in peace all thine, O Flag!   And here, and hence, for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for them!   And here and hence, O Union, all the work and workmen thine!   The poets, women, sailors, soldiers, farmers, miners, students thine!   None separate from Thee--henceforth one only, we and Thou;        250   (For the blood of the children--what is it only the blood Maternal?   And lives and works--what are they all at last except the roads to         Faith and Death?)   While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear         Mother!   We own it all and several to-day indissoluble in Thee;   --Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross, or         lucre--it is for Thee, the Soul, electric, spiritual!   Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in Thee! Cities and States in         Thee!   Our freedom all in Thee! our very lives in Thee!                            SUDDENLY, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,   Like lightning it le'pt forth, half startled at itself,   Its feet upon the ashes and the rags--its hands tight to the throats         of kings.   O hope and faith!   O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!   O many a sicken'd heart!   Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.   And you, paid to defile the People! you liars, mark!   Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,   For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his         simplicity the poor man's wages,                             10   For many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laugh'd at in         the breaking,   Then in their power, not for all these, did the blows strike revenge,         or the heads of the nobles fall;   The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.   But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the         frighten'd monarchs come back;   Each comes in state, with his train--hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,   Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.   Yet behind all, lowering, stealing--lo, a Shape,   Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in         scarlet folds,   Whose face and eyes none may see,   Out of its robes only this--the red robes, lifted by the arm,      20   One finger, crook'd, pointed high over the top, like the head of a         snake appears.   Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves--bloody corpses of young         men;   The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are         flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,   And all these things bear fruits--and they are good.   Those corpses of young men,   Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets--those hearts pierc'd by the         gray lead,   Cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughter'd         vitality.   They live in other young men, O kings!   They live in brothers, again ready to defy you!   They were purified by death--they were taught and exalted.         30   Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom, but grows seed for freedom,         in its turn to bear seed,   Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows         nourish.   Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,   But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling,         cautioning.   Liberty! let others despair of you! I never despair of you.   Is the house shut? Is the master away?   Nevertheless, be ready--be not weary of watching;   He will soon return--his messengers come anon.                                                 ONE sweeps by, attended by an immense train,   All emblematic of peace--not a soldier or menial among them.   One sweeps by, old, with black eyes, and profuse white hair,   He has the simple magnificence of health and strength,   His face strikes as with flashes of lightning whoever it turns         toward.   Three old men slowly pass, followed by three others, and they by         three others,   They are beautiful--the one in the middle of each group holds his         companions by the hand,   As they walk, they give out perfume wherever they walk.                            BY the City Dead-House, by the gate,   As idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangor,   I curious pause--for lo! an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute         brought;   Her corpse they deposit unclaim'd--it lies on the damp brick         pavement;   The divine woman, her body--I see the Body--I look on it alone,   That house once full of passion and beauty--all else I notice not;   Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors         morbific impress me;   But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house--         that ruin!   That immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!   Or white-domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure surmounted--or         all the old high-spired cathedrals;                          10   That little house alone, more than them all--poor, desperate house!   Fair, fearful wreck! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!   Unclaim'd, avoided house! take one breath from my tremulous lips;   Take one tear, dropt aside as I go, for thought of you,   Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! crush'd!   House of life--erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house!         dead, even then;   Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house--but dead, dead, dead.                            AND now, gentlemen,   A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,   As base, and finale too, for all metaphysics.   (So, to the students, the old professor,   At the close of his crowded course.)   Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems,   Kant having studied and stated--Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,   Stated the lore of Plato--and Socrates, greater than Plato,   And greater than Socrates sought and stated--Christ divine having         studied long,   I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems,         10   See the philosophies all--Christian churches and tenets see,   Yet underneath Socrates clearly see--and underneath Christ the divine         I see,   The dear love of man for his comrade--the attraction of friend to         friend,   Of the well-married husband and wife--of children and parents,   Of city for city, and land for land.                            NOT heat flames up and consumes,   Not sea-waves hurry in and out,   Not the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe summer, bears         lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,   Wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;   Not these--O none of these, more than the flames of me, consuming,         burning for his love whom I love!   O none, more than I, hurrying in and out:   --Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the         same;   O nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high, rain-emitting clouds,         are borne through the open air,   Any more than my Soul is borne through the open air,   Wafted in all directions, O love, for friendship, for you.         10                            PENSIVE, on her dead gazing, I heard the Mother of All,   Desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-         fields gazing;   (As the last gun ceased--but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd;)   As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd:   Absorb them well, O my earth, she cried--I charge you, lose not my         sons! lose not an atom;   And you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood;   And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly,   And all you essences of soil and growth--and you, my rivers' depths;   And you, mountain sides--and the woods where my dear children's         blood, trickling, redden'd;   And you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future         trees,                                                       10   My dead absorb--my young men's beautiful bodies absorb--and their         precious, precious, precious blood;   Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a         year hence,   In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence;   In blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings--give         my immortal heroes;   Exhale me them centuries hence--breathe me their breath--let not an         atom be lost;   O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!   Exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence.                            WHERE the city's ceaseless crowd moves on, the live-long day,   Withdrawn, I join a group of children watching--I pause aside with         them.   By the curb, toward the edge of the flagging,   A knife-grinder works at his wheel, sharpening a great knife;   Bending over, he carefully holds it to the stone--by foot and knee,   With measur'd tread, he turns rapidly--As he presses with light but         firm hand,   Forth issue, then, in copious golden jets,   Sparkles from the wheel.   The scene, and all its belongings--how they seize and affect me!   The sad, sharp-chinn'd old man, with worn clothes, and broad         shoulder-band of leather;                                    10   Myself, effusing and fluid--a phantom curiously floating--now here         absorb'd and arrested;   The group, (an unminded point, set in a vast surrounding;)   The attentive, quiet children--the loud, proud, restive base of the         streets;   The low, hoarse purr of the whirling stone--the light-press'd blade,   Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold,   Sparkles from the wheel.                            CHANTING the square deific, out of the One advancing, out of the         sides;   Out of the old and new--out of the square entirely divine,   Solid, four-sided, (all the sides needed)... from this side JEHOVAH         am I,   Old Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;   Not Time affects me--I am Time, old, modern as any;   Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments;   As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,   Aged beyond computation--yet ever new--ever with those mighty laws         rolling,   Relentless, I forgive no man--whoever sins, dies--I will have that         man's life;   Therefore let none expect mercy--Have the seasons, gravitation, the         appointed days, mercy?--No more have I;                      10   But as the seasons, and gravitation--and as all the appointed days,         that forgive not,   I dispense from this side judgments inexorable, without the least         remorse.   Consolator most mild, the promis'd one advancing,   With gentle hand extended--the mightier God am I,   Foretold by prophets and poets, in their most rapt prophecies and         poems;   From this side, lo! the Lord CHRIST gazes--lo! Hermes I--lo! mine is         Hercules' face;   All sorrow, labor, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself;   Many times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and         crucified--and many times shall be again;   All the world have I given up for my dear brothers' and sisters'         sake--for the soul's sake;   Wending my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with the kiss         of affection;                                                20   For I am affection--I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope, and all-         enclosing Charity;   (Conqueror yet--for before me all the armies and soldiers of the         earth shall yet bow--and all the weapons of war become         impotent:)   With indulgent words, as to children--with fresh and sane words, mine         only;   Young and strong I pass, knowing well I am destin'd myself to an         early death:   But my Charity has no death--my Wisdom dies not, neither early nor         late,   And my sweet Love, bequeath'd here and elsewhere, never dies.   Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,   Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,   Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,   With sudra face and worn brow, black, but in the depths of my heart,         proud as any;                                                30   Lifted, now and always, against whoever, scorning, assumes to rule         me;   Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many         wiles,   (Though it was thought I was baffled and dispell'd, and my wiles         done--but that will never be;)   Defiant, I, SATAN, still live--still utter words--in new lands duly         appearing, (and old ones also;)   Permanent here, from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,   Nor time, nor change, shall ever change me or my words.   Santa SPIRITA, breather, life,   Beyond the light, lighter than light,   Beyond the flames of hell--joyous, leaping easily above hell;   Beyond Paradise--perfumed solely with mine own perfume;            40   Including all life on earth--touching, including God--including         Saviour and Satan;   Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me, what were all? what were         God?)   Essence of forms--life of the real identities, permanent, positive,         (namely the unseen,)   Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man--I, the         general Soul,   Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,   Breathe my breath also through these songs.                            A THOUSAND perfect men and women appear,   Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and         youths, with offerings.                            ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for         future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and         traditions;   Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I casually met         there, who detain'd me for love of me;   Day by day and night by night we were together,--All else has long         been forgotten by me;   I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately clung to me;   Again we wander--we love--we separate again;   Again she holds me by the hand--I must not go!   I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous.                                                 IN the new garden, in all the parts,   In cities now, modern, I wander,   Though the second or third result, or still further, primitive yet,   Days, places, indifferent--though various, the same,   Time, Paradise, the Mannahatta, the prairies, finding me unchanged,   Death indifferent--Is it that I lived long since? Was I buried very         long ago?   For all that, I may now be watching you here, this moment;   For the future, with determined will, I seek--the woman of the         future,   You, born years, centuries after me, I seek.                                                 WHAT weeping face is that looking from the window?   Why does it stream those sorrowful tears?   Is it for some burial place, vast and dry?   Is it to wet the soil of graves?                            SPIRIT whose work is done! spirit of dreadful hours!   Ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;   Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering         pressing;)   Spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene! Electric         spirit!   That with muttering voice, through the war now closed, like a         tireless phantom flitted,   Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the         drum;   --Now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,         reverberates round me;   As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles;   While the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders;  10   While I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders;   While those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, appearing in the         distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,   Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the right and left,   Evenly, lightly rising and falling, as the steps keep time;   --Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death         next day;   Touch my mouth, ere you depart--press my lips close!   Leave me your pulses of rage! bequeath them to me! fill me with         currents convulsive!   Let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you are gone;   Let them identify you to the future, in these songs.                                                 ROAMING in thought over the Universe, I saw the little that is Good         steadily hastening towards immortality,   And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening to merge itself         and become lost and dead.                            WHO are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,   With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?   Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?   ('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sand and pines,   Forth from thy hovel door, thou, Ethiopia, com'st to me,   As, under doughty Sherman, I march toward the sea.)   Me, master, years a hundred, since from my parents sunder'd,   A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught;   Then hither me, across the sea, the cruel slaver brought.   No further does she say, but lingering all the day,                10   Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,   And curtseys to the regiments, the guidons moving by.   What is it, fateful woman--so blear, hardly human?   Why wag your head, with turban bound--yellow, red and green?   Are the things so strange and marvelous, you see or have seen?                                                 OF the visages of things--And of piercing through to the accepted         hells beneath;   Of ugliness--To me there is just as much in it as there is in         beauty--And now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to         me;   Of detected persons--To me, detected persons are not, in any respect,         worse than undetected persons--and are not in any respect worse         than I am myself;   Of criminals--To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal--         and any reputable person is also--and the President is also.                                                 THROUGH the soft evening air enwrinding all,   Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,   In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,   Electric, pensive, turbulent artificial,   (Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,   Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,   Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the opera         house,   Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,   Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's anguish,   And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)                                  10   Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,   Music, Italian music in Dakota.   While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,   Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,   Acknowledging rapport however far remov'd,   (As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,)   Listens well pleas'd.                            THERE was a child went forth every day;   And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;   And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of         the day, or for many years, or stretching cycles of years.   The early lilacs became part of this child,   And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and white and red         clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,   And the Third-month lambs, and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the         mare's foal, and the cow's calf,   And the noisy brood of the barn-yard, or by the mire of the pond-         side,   And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there--and the         beautiful curious liquid,   And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads--all became part         of him.   The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of         him;                                                         10   Winter-grain sprouts, and those of the light-yellow corn, and the         esculent roots of the garden,   And the apple-trees cover'd with blossoms, and the fruit afterward,         and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road;   And the old drunkard staggering home from the out-house of the         tavern, whence he had lately risen,   And the school-mistress that pass'd on her way to the school,   And the friendly boys that pass'd--and the quarrelsome boys,   And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls--and the barefoot negro boy and         girl,   And all the changes of city and country, wherever he went.   His own parents,   He that had father'd him, and she that had conceiv'd him in her womb,         and birth'd him,   They gave this child more of themselves than that;                 20   They gave him afterward every day--they became part of him.   The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table;   The mother with mild words--clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor         falling off her person and clothes as she walks by;   The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust;   The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,   The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture--the         yearning and swelling heart,   Affection that will not be gainsay'd--the sense of what is real--the         thought if, after all, it should prove unreal,   The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time--the curious         whether and how,   Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?   Men and women crowding fast in the streets--if they are not flashes         and specks, what are they?                                   30   The streets themselves, and the façades of houses, and goods in the         windows,   Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves--the huge crossing at the         ferries,   The village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset--the river         between,   Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of         white or brown, three miles off,   The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide--the little         boat slack-tow'd astern,   The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,   The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint, away         solitary by itself--the spread of purity it lies motionless in,   The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh         and shore mud;   These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now         goes, and will always go forth every day.                                                 HAST never come to thee an hour,   A sudden gleam divine, precipitating, bursting all these bubbles,         fashions, wealth?   These eager business aims--books, politics, art, amours,   To utter nothingness?                            FAST-ANCHOR'D, eternal, O love! O woman I love!   O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of you!   --Then separate, as disembodied, or another born,   Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation;   I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,   O sharer of my roving life.                            YEARS of the modern! years of the unperform'd!   Your horizon rises--I see it parting away for more august dramas;   I see not America only--I see not only Liberty's nation, but other         nations preparing;   I see tremendous entrances and exits--I see new combinations--I see         the solidarity of races;   I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's         stage;   (Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts         suitable to them closed?)   I see Freedom, completely arm'd, and victorious, and very haughty,         with Law on one side, and Peace on the other,   A stupendous Trio, all issuing forth against the idea of caste;   --What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?   I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions;          10   I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken;   I see the landmarks of European kings removed;   I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give         way;)   --Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day;   Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God;   Lo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest;   His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere--he colonizes the         Pacific, the archipelagoes;   With the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the         wholesale engines of war,   With these, and the world-spreading factories, he interlinks all         geography, all lands;   --What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing         under the seas?                                              20   Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the         globe?   Is humanity forming, en-masse?--for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow         dim;   The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine         war;   No one knows what will happen next--such portents fill the days and         nights;   Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to         pierce it, is full of phantoms;   Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;   This incredible rush and heat--this strange extatic fever of dreams,         O years!   Your dreams, O year, how they penetrate through me! (I know not         whether I sleep or wake!)   The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind         me,   The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon         me.                                                          30                            PROUD music of the storm!   Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies!   Strong hum of forest tree-tops! Wind of the mountains!   Personified dim shapes! you hidden orchestras!   You serenades of phantoms, with instruments alert,   Blending, with Nature's rhythmus, all the tongues of nations;   You chords left us by vast composers! you choruses!   You formless, free, religious dances! you from the Orient!   You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts;   You sounds from distant guns, with galloping cavalry!              10   Echoes of camps, with all the different bugle-calls!   Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless,   Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber--Why have you seiz'd me?   Come forward, O my Soul, and let the rest retire;   Listen--lose not--it is toward thee they tend;   Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,   For thee they sing and dance, O Soul.   A festival song!   The duet of the bridegroom and the bride--a marriage-march,   With lips of love, and hearts of lovers, fill'd to the brim with         love;                                                        20   The red-flush'd cheeks, and perfumes--the cortege swarming, full of         friendly faces, young and old,   To flutes' clear notes, and sounding harps' cantabile.   Now loud approaching drums!   Victoria! see'st thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but flying?         the rout of the baffled?   Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?   (Ah, Soul, the sobs of women--the wounded groaning in agony,   The hiss and crackle of flames--the blacken'd ruins--the embers of         cities,   The dirge and desolation of mankind.)   Now airs antique and medieval fill me!   I see and hear old harpers with their harps, at Welsh festivals:   30   I hear the minnesingers, singing their lays of love,   I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the feudal ages.   Now the great organ sounds,   Tremulous--while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth,   On which arising, rest, and leaping forth, depend,   All shapes of beauty, grace and strength--all hues we know,   Green blades of grass, and warbling birds--children that gambol and         play--the clouds of heaven above,)   The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,   Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest--maternity of all the rest;   And with it every instrument in multitudes,                        40   The players playing--all the world's musicians,   The solemn hymns and masses, rousing adoration,   All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,   The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,   And for their solvent setting, Earth's own diapason,   Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves;   A new composite orchestra--binder of years and climes--ten-fold         renewer,   As of the far-back days the poets tell--the Paradiso,   The straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done,   The journey done, the Journeyman come home,                        50   And Man and Art, with Nature fused again.   Tutti! for Earth and Heaven!   The Almighty Leader now for me, for once has signal'd with his wand.   The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,   And all the wives responding.   The tongues of violins!   (I think, O tongues, ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself;   This brooding, yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)   Ah, from a little child,   Thou knowest, Soul, how to me all sounds became music;             60   My mother's voice, in lullaby or hymn;   (The voice--O tender voices--memory's loving voices!   Last miracle of all--O dearest mother's, sister's, voices;)   The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-leav'd corn,   The measur'd sea-surf, beating on the sand,   The twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream,   The wild-fowl's notes at night, as flying low, migrating north or         south,   The psalm in the country church, or mid the clustering trees, the         open air camp-meeting,   The fiddler in the tavern--the glee, the long-strung sailor-song,   The lowing cattle, bleating sheep--the crowing cock at dawn.       70   All songs of current lands come sounding 'round me,   The German airs of friendship, wine and love,   Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances--English warbles,   Chansons of France, Scotch tunes--and o'er the rest,   Italia's peerless compositions.   Across the stage, with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,   Stalks Norma, brandishing the dagger in her hand.   I see poor crazed Lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam;   Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevell'd.   I see where Ernani, walking the bridal garden,                     80   Amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by the         hand,   Hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.   To crossing swords, and grey hairs bared to heaven,   The clear, electric base and baritone of the world,   The trombone duo--Libertad forever!   From Spanish chestnut trees' dense shade,   By old and heavy convent walls, a wailing song,   Song of lost love--the torch of youth and life quench'd in despair,   Song of the dying swan--Fernando's heart is breaking.   Awaking from her woes at last, retriev'd Amina sings;              90   Copious as stars, and glad as morning light, the torrents of her joy.   (The teeming lady comes!   The lustrious orb--Venus contralto--the blooming mother,   Sister of loftiest gods--Alboni's self I hear.)   I hear those odes, symphonies, operas;   I hear in the William Tell, the music of an arous'd and angry people;   I hear Meyerbeer's Huguenots, the Prophet, or Robert;   Gounod's Faust, or Mozart's Don Juan.   I hear the dance-music of all nations,   The waltz, (some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in         bliss;)                                                     100   The bolero, to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.   I see religious dances old and new,   I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,   I see the Crusaders marching, bearing the cross on high, to the         martial clang of cymbals;   I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic         shouts, as they spin around, turning always towards Mecca;   I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs;   Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks dancing,   I hear them clapping their hands, as they bend their bodies,   I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.   I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers wounding         each other;                                                 110   I see the Roman youth, to the shrill sound of flageolets, throwing         and catching their weapons,   As they fall on their knees, and rise again.   I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling;   I see the worshippers within, (nor form, nor sermon, argument, nor         word,   But silent, strange, devout--rais'd, glowing heads--extatic faces.)   I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,   The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen;   The sacred imperial hymns of China,   To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone;)   Or to Hindu flutes, and the fretting twang of the vina,           120   A band of bayaderes.   Now Asia, Africa leave me--Europe, seizing, inflates me;   To organs huge, and bands, I hear as from vast concourses of voices,   Luther's strong hymn, Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott;   Rossini's Stabat Mater dolorosa;   Or, floating in some high cathedral dim, with gorgeous color'd         windows,   The passionate Agnus Dei, or Gloria in Excelsis.   Composers! mighty maestros!   And you, sweet singers of old lands--Soprani! Tenori! Bassi!   To you a new bard, carolling free in the west,   Obeisant, sends his love.                                         130   (Such led to thee, O Soul!   All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,   But now, it seems to me, sound leads o'er all the rest.)   I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul's Cathedral;   Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,         oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn;   The Creation, in billows of godhood laves me.   Give me to hold all sounds, (I, madly struggling, cry,)   Fill me with all the voices of the universe,   Endow me with their throbbings--Nature's also,   The tempests, waters, winds--operas and chants--marches and         dances,                                                     140   Utter--pour in--for I would take them all.   Then I woke softly,   And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,   And questioning all those reminiscences--the tempest in its fury,   And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,   And those rapt oriental dances, of religious fervor,   And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs,   And all the artless plaints of love, and grief and death,   I said to my silent, curious Soul, out of the bed of the slumber-         chamber,   Come, for I have found the clue I sought so long,                 150   Let us go forth refresh'd amid the day,   Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,   Nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream.   And I said, moreover,   Haply, what thou hast heard, O Soul, was not the sound of winds,   Nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk's flapping wings, nor harsh         scream,   Nor vocalism of sun-bright Italy,   Nor German organ majestic--nor vast concourse of voices--nor layers         of harmonies;   Nor strophes of husbands and wives--nor sound of marching soldiers,   Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps;              160   But, to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,   Poems, bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted in night         air, uncaught, unwritten,   Which, let us go forth in the bold day, and write.                            ALL submit to them, where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to         analysis, in the Soul;   Not traditions--not the outer authorities are the judges--they are         the judges of outer authorities, and of all traditions;   They corroborate as they go, only whatever corroborates themselves,         and touches themselves;   For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far         and near, without one exception.                            HUSH'D be the camps to-day;   And, soldiers, let us drape our war-worn weapons;   And each with musing soul retire, to celebrate,   Our dear commander's death.   No more for him life's stormy conflicts;   Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,   Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.   But sing, poet, in our name;   Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it         truly.   As they invault the coffin there;                                  10   Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,   For the heavy hearts of soldiers.                                                 SKIRTING the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)   Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,   The rushing amorous contact high in space together,   The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,   Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,   In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,   Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,   A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,   Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse         flight,   She hers, he his, pursuing.                                        10                            AT the last, tenderly,   From the walls of the powerful, fortress'd house,   From the clasp of the knitted locks--from the keep of the well-closed         doors,   Let me be wafted.   Let me glide noiselessly forth;   With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,   Set ope the doors, O Soul!   Tenderly! be not impatient!   (Strong is your hold, O mortal flesh!   Strong is your hold, O love.)                                      10                            RISE, O days, from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer         sweep!   Long for my soul, hungering gymnastic, I devour'd what the earth gave         me;   Long I roam'd the woods of the north--long I watch'd Niagara pouring;   I travel'd the prairies over, and slept on their breast--I cross'd         the Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus;   I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea;   I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm;   I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves;   I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over;   I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds;   Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my heart,         and powerful!)                                               10   Heard the continuous thunder, as it bellow'd after the lightning;   Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning, as sudden and fast         amid the din they chased each other across the sky;   --These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet         pensive and masterful;   All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me;   Yet there with my soul I fed--I fed content, supercilious.   'Twas well, O soul! 'twas a good preparation you gave me!   Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill;   Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us;   Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities;   Something for us is pouring now, more than Niagara pouring;        20   Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest, are you indeed         inexhaustible?)   What, to pavements and homesteads here--what were those storms of the         mountains and sea?   What, to passions I witness around me to-day? Was the sea risen?   Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?   Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage;   Manhattan, rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati,         Chicago, unchain'd;   --What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here!   How it climbs with daring feet and hands! how it dashes!   How the true thunder bellows after the lightning! how bright the         flashes of lightning!   How DEMOCRACY, with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through         the dark by those flashes of lightning!                      30   (Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,   In a lull of the deafening confusion.)   Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!   And do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!   Crash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good;   My soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong         nutriment;   --Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads, through farms, only         half-satisfied;   One doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground         before me,   Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically         hissing low;   --The cities I loved so well, I abandon'd and left--I sped to the         certainties suitable to me;                                  40   Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies, and Nature's         dauntlessness,   I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only;   I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I         waited long;   --But now I no longer wait--I am fully satisfied--I am glutted;   I have witness'd the true lightning--I have witness'd my cities         electric;   I have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike America rise;   Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,   No more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea.                                                 I SEE the sleeping babe, nestling the breast of its mother;    The sleeping mother and babe- hush'd, I study them long and long.                                                 RESPONDEZ! Respondez!   (The war is completed--the price is paid--the title is settled beyond         recall;)   Let every one answer! let those who sleep be waked! let none evade!   Must we still go on with our affectations and sneaking?   Let me bring this to a close--I pronounce openly for a new         distribution of roles;   Let that which stood in front go behind! and let that which was         behind advance to the front and speak;   Let murderers, bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new         propositions!   Let the old propositions be postponed!   Let faces and theories be turn'd inside out! let meanings be freely         criminal, as well as results!   Let there be no suggestion above the suggestion of drudgery! 10   Let none be pointed toward his destination! (Say! do you know your         destination?)   Let men and women be mock'd with bodies and mock'd with Souls!   Let the love that waits in them, wait! let it die, or pass stillborn         to other spheres!   Let the sympathy that waits in every man, wait! or let it also pass,         a dwarf, to other spheres!   Let contradictions prevail! let one thing contradict another! and let         one line of my poems contradict another!   Let the people sprawl with yearning, aimless hands! let their tongues         be broken! let their eyes be discouraged! let none descend into         their hearts with the fresh lusciousness of love!   (Stifled, O days! O lands! in every public and private corruption!   Smother'd in thievery, impotence, shamelessness, mountain-high;   Brazen effrontery, scheming, rolling like ocean's waves around and         upon you, O my days! my lands!   For not even those thunderstorms, nor fiercest lightnings of the war,         have purified the atmosphere;)                               20   --Let the theory of America still be management, caste, comparison!         (Say! what other theory would you?)   Let them that distrust birth and death still lead the rest! (Say! why         shall they not lead you?)   Let the crust of hell be neared and trod on! let the days be darker         than the nights! let slumber bring less slumber than waking         time brings!   Let the world never appear to him or her for whom it was all made!   Let the heart of the young man still exile itself from the heart of         the old man! and let the heart of the old man be exiled from         that of the young man!   Let the sun and moon go! let scenery take the applause of the         audience! let there be apathy under the stars!   Let freedom prove no man's inalienable right! every one who can         tyrannize, let him tyrannize to his satisfaction!   Let none but infidels be countenanced!   Let the eminence of meanness, treachery, sarcasm, hate, greed,         indecency, impotence, lust, be taken for granted above all! let         writers, judges, governments, households, religions,         philosophies, take such for granted above all!

Let judges and criminals be transposed! let the prison-keepers be put         in prison! let those that were prisoners take the keys! Say!         why might they not just as well be transposed?)

Let the preachers recite creeds! let them still teach only what they         have been taught!   Let insanity still have charge of sanity!   Let books take the place of trees, animals, rivers, clouds!   Let the daub'd portraits of heroes supersede heroes!               60   Let the manhood of man never take steps after itself!   Let it take steps after eunuchs, and after consumptive and genteel         persons!   Let the white person again tread the black person under his heel!         (Say! which is trodden under heel, after all?)   Let the reflections of the things of the world be studied in mirrors!         let the things themselves still continue unstudied!   Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself!   Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself!

Once, Paumanok,   When the snows had melted--when the lilac-scent was in the air, and         the Fifth-month grass was growing,   Up this sea-shore, in some briers,   Two guests from Alabama--two together,   And their nest, and four light-green eggs, spotted with brown,   And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,   And every day the she-bird, crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright         eyes,   And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing         them,                                                        30   Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.   Shine! shine! shine!   Pour down your warmth, great Sun!   While we bask--we two together.   Two together!   Winds blow South, or winds blow North,   Day come white, or night come black,   Home, or rivers and mountains from home,   Singing all time, minding no time,   While we two keep together.                                        40   Till of a sudden,   May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,   One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,   Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,   Nor ever appear'd again.   And thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,   And at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather,   Over the hoarse surging of the sea,   Or flitting from brier to brier by day,   I saw, I heard at intervals, the remaining one, the he-bird,       50   The solitary guest from Alabama.   Blow! blow! blow!   Blow up, sea-winds, along Paumanok's shore!   I wait and I wait, till you blow my mate to me.   Yes, when the stars glisten'd,   All night long, on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,   Down, almost amid the slapping waves,   Sat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears.   He call'd on his mate;   He pour'd forth the meanings which I, of all men, know.            60   Yes, my brother, I know;   The rest might not--but I have treasur'd every note;   For once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding,   Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,   Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights         after their sorts,   The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,   I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,   Listen'd long and long.   Listen'd, to keep, to sing--now translating the notes,   Following you, my brother.                                         70   Soothe! soothe! soothe!   Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,   And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,   But my love soothes not me, not me.   Low hangs the moon--it rose late;   O it is lagging--O I think it is heavy with love, with love.   O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,   With love--with love.   O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among the         breakers?   What is that little black thing I see there in the white?          80   Loud! loud! loud!   Loud I call to you, my love!   High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves;   Surely you must know who is here, is here;   You must know who I am, my love.   Low-hanging moon!   What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?   O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!   O moon, do not keep her from me any longer.   Land! land! O land!                                                90   Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again,         if you only would;   For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.   O rising stars!   Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.   O throat! O trembling throat!   Sound clearer through the atmosphere!   Pierce the woods, the earth;   Somewhere listening to catch you, must be the one I want.   Shake out, carols!   Solitary here--the night's carols!                                100   Carols of lonesome love! Death's carols!   Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!   O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea!   O reckless, despairing carols.   But soft! sink low;   Soft! let me just murmur;   And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;   For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,   So faint--I must be still, be still to listen;   But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to         me.                                                         110   Hither, my love!   Here I am! Here!   With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you;   This gentle call is for you, my love, for you.   Do not be decoy'd elsewhere!   That is the whistle of the wind--it is not my voice;   That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;   Those are the shadows of leaves.   O darkness! O in vain!   O I am very sick and sorrowful.                                   120   O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea!   O troubled reflection in the sea!   O throat! O throbbing heart!   O all--and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.   Yet I murmur, murmur on!   O murmurs--you yourselves make me continue to sing, I know not why.   O past! O life! O songs of joy!   In the air--in the woods--over fields;   Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!   But my love no more, no more with me!                             130   We two together no more.   The aria sinking;   All else continuing--the stars shining,   The winds blowing--the notes of the bird continuous echoing,   With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,   On the sands of Paumanok's shore, gray and rustling;   The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of         the sea almost touching;   The boy extatic--with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the         atmosphere dallying,   The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously         bursting,   The aria's meaning, the ears, the Soul, swiftly depositing,       140   The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,   The colloquy there--the trio--each uttering,   The undertone--the savage old mother, incessantly crying,   To the boy's Soul's questions sullenly timing--some drown'd secret         hissing,   To the outsetting bard of love.   Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)   Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me?   For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping,   Now I have heard you,   Now in a moment I know what I am for--I awake,                    150   And already a thousand singers--a thousand songs, clearer, louder and         more sorrowful than yours,   A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me,   Never to die.   O you singer, solitary, singing by yourself--projecting me;   O solitary me, listening--nevermore shall I cease perpetuating you;   Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,   Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,   Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what         there, in the night,   By the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,   The messenger there arous'd--the fire, the sweet hell within,     160   The unknown want, the destiny of me.   O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere;)   O if I am to have so much, let me have more!   O a word! O what is my destination? (I fear it is henceforth chaos;)   O how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes, and all shapes,         spring as from graves around me!   O phantoms! you cover all the land and all the sea!   O I cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me;   O vapor, a look, a word! O well-beloved!   O you dear women's and men's phantoms!   A word then, (for I will conquer it,)                             170   The word final, superior to all,   Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;   Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?   Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?   Whereto answering, the sea,   Delaying not, hurrying not,   Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before day-break,   Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word DEATH;   And again Death--ever Death, Death, Death,   Hissing melodious, neither like the bird, nor like my arous'd child's         heart,                                                      180   But edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,   Creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all         over,   Death, Death, Death, Death, Death.   Which I do not forget,   But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,   That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray beach,   With the thousand responsive songs, at random,   My own songs, awaked from that hour;   And with them the key, the word up from the waves,   The word of the sweetest song, and all songs, 190   That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,   The sea whisper'd me.                            FROM pent-up, aching rivers;   From that of myself, without which I were nothing;   From what I am determin'd to make illustrious, even if I stand sole         among men;   From my own voice resonant--singing the phallus,   Singing the song of procreation,   Singing the need of superb children, and therein superb grown people,   Singing the muscular urge and the blending,   Singing the bedfellow's song, (O resistless yearning!   O for any and each, the body correlative attracting!   O for you, whoever you are, your correlative body! O it, more than         all else, you delighting!)                                   10   --From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day;   From native moments--from bashful pains--singing them;   Singing something yet unfound, though I have diligently sought it,         many a long year;   Singing the true song of the Soul, fitful, at random;   Singing what, to the Soul, entirely redeem'd her, the faithful one,         even the prostitute, who detain'd me when I went to the city;   Singing the song of prostitutes;   Renascent with grossest Nature, or among animals;   Of that--of them, and what goes with them, my poems informing;   Of the smell of apples and lemons--of the pairing of birds,   Of the wet of woods--of the lapping of waves,                      20   Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land--I them chanting;   The overture lightly sounding--the strain anticipating;   The welcome nearness--the sight of the perfect body;   The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his back         lying and floating;   The female form approaching--I, pensive, love-flesh tremulous,         aching;   The divine list, for myself or you, or for any one, making;   The face--the limbs--the index from head to foot, and what it         arouses;   The mystic deliria--the madness amorous--the utter abandonment;   (Hark close, and still, what I now whisper to you,   I love you---O you entirely possess me, 30   O I wish that you and I escape from the rest, and go utterly off--O         free and lawless,   Two hawks in the air--two fishes swimming in the sea not more lawless         than we;)   --The furious storm through me careering--I passionately trembling;   The oath of the inseparableness of two together--of the woman that         loves me, and whom I love more than my life--that oath         swearing;   (O I willingly stake all, for you!   O let me be lost, if it must be so!   O you and I--what is it to us what the rest do or think?   What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other, and exhaust         each other, if it must be so:)   --From the master--the pilot I yield the vessel to;   The general commanding me, commanding all--from him permission         taking;                                                      40   From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter'd too long, as it         is;)   From sex--From the warp and from the woof;   (To talk to the perfect girl who understands me,   To waft to her these from my own lips--to effuse them from my own         body;)   From privacy--from frequent repinings alone;   From plenty of persons near, and yet the right person not near;   From the soft sliding of hands over me, and thrusting of fingers         through my hair and beard;   From the long sustain'd kiss upon the mouth or bosom;   From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting with         excess;   From what the divine husband knows--from the work of fatherhood;   50   From exultation, victory, and relief--from the bedfellow's embrace in         the night;   From the act-poems of eyes, hands, hips, and bosoms,   From the cling of the trembling arm,   From the bending curve and the clinch,   From side by side, the pliant coverlid off-throwing,   From the one so unwilling to have me leave--and me just as unwilling         to leave,   (Yet a moment, O tender waiter, and I return;)   --From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,   From the night, a moment, I, emerging, flitting out,   Celebrate you, act divine--and you, children prepared for,         60   And you, stalwart loins.                         When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom'd   WHEN lilacs last in the door-yard bloom'd,   And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,   I mourn'd--and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.   O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;   Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,   And thought of him I love.   O powerful, western, fallen star!   O shades of night! O moody, tearful night!   O great star disappear'd! O the black murk that hides the star!   O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul of me!       10   O harsh surrounding cloud, that will not free my soul!   In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house, near the white-wash'd         palings,   Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich         green,   With many a pointed blossom, rising, delicate, with the perfume         strong I love,   With every leaf a miracle......and from this bush in the door-yard,   With delicate-color'd blossoms, and heart-shaped leaves of rich         green,   A sprig, with its flower, I break.   In the swamp, in secluded recesses,   A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.   Solitary, the thrush,                                              20   The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,   Sings by himself a song.   Song of the bleeding throat!   Death's outlet song of life--(for well, dear brother, I know   If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would'st surely die.)   Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,   Amid lanes, and through old woods, (where lately the violets peep'd         from the ground, spotting the gray debris;)   Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes--passing the         endless grass;   Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the         dark-brown fields uprising;   Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards;    30   Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,   Night and day journeys a coffin.   Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,   Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,   With the pomp of the inloop'd flags, with the cities draped in black,   With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil'd women,         standing,   With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,   With the countless torches lit--with the silent sea of faces, and the         unbared heads,   With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,   With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong         and solemn;                                                  40   With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour'd around the coffin,   The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--Where amid these you         journey,   With the tolling, tolling bells' perpetual clang;   Here! coffin that slowly passes,   I give you my sprig of lilac.   (Nor for you, for one, alone;   Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:   For fresh as the morning--thus would I carol a song for you, O sane         and sacred death.   All over bouquets of roses,   O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;             50   But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,   Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes;   With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,   For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.)   O western orb, sailing the heaven!   Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walk'd,   As we walk'd up and down in the dark blue so mystic,   As we walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,   As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after         night,   As you droop'd from the sky low down, as if to my side, (while the         other stars all look'd on;)                                  60   As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something, I know not         what, kept me from sleep;)   As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you         went, how full you were of woe;   As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold         transparent night,   As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of         the night,   As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad         orb,   Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.   Sing on, there in the swamp!   O singer bashful and tender! I hear your notes--I hear your call;   I hear--I come presently--I understand you;   But a moment I linger--for the lustrous star has detain'd me;      70   The star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me.   O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?   And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?   And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love?   Sea-winds, blown from east and west,   Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till         there on the prairies meeting:   These, and with these, and the breath of my chant,   I perfume the grave of him I love.   O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?   And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,           80   To adorn the burial-house of him I love?   Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,   With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and         bright,   With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking         sun, burning, expanding the air;   With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of         the trees prolific;   In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a         wind-dapple here and there;   With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,         and shadows;   And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of         chimneys,   And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen         homeward returning.   Lo! body and soul! this land!                                      90   Mighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,         and the ships;   The varied and ample land--the South and the North in the light--         Ohio's shores, and flashing Missouri,   And ever the far-spreading prairies, cover'd with grass and corn.   Lo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty;   The violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes;   The gentle, soft-born, measureless light;   The miracle, spreading, bathing all--the fulfill'd noon;   The coming eve, delicious--the welcome night, and the stars,   Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.   Sing on! sing on, you gray-brown bird!                            100   Sing from the swamps, the recesses--pour your chant from the bushes;   Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.   Sing on, dearest brother--warble your reedy song;   Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.   O liquid, and free, and tender!   O wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous singer!   You only I hear......yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart;)   Yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me.   Now while I sat in the day, and look'd forth,   In the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring,         and the farmer preparing his crops,                         110   In the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and         forests,   In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds, and the         storms;)   Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the         voices of children and women,   The many-moving sea-tides,--and I saw the ships how they sail'd,   And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy         with labor,   And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its         meals and minutia of daily usages;   And the streets, how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--         lo! then and there,   Falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the         rest,   Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail;   And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. 120   Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,   And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,   And I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of         companions,   I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,   Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the         dimness,   To the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still.   And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me;   The gray-brown bird I know, receiv'd us comrades three;   And he sang what seem'd the carol of death, and a verse for him I         love.   From deep secluded recesses,                                      130   From the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,   Came the carol of the bird.   And the charm of the carol rapt me,   As I held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night;   And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.                             DEATH CAROL.   Come, lovely and soothing Death,   Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,   In the day, in the night, to all, to each,   Sooner or later, delicate Death.   Prais'd be the fathomless universe,                               140   For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;   And for love, sweet love--But praise! praise! praise!   For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death.   Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,   Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?   Then I chant it for thee--I glorify thee above all;   I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come         unfalteringly.   Approach, strong Deliveress!   When it is so--when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,   Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,                       150   Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.   From me to thee glad serenades,   Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee--adornments and feastings         for thee;   And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are         fitting,   And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.   The night, in silence, under many a star;   The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;   And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil'd Death,   And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.   Over the tree-tops I float thee a song!                           160   Over the rising and sinking waves--over the myriad fields, and the         prairies wide;   Over the dense-pack'd cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,   I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death!   To the tally of my soul,   Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,   With pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night.   Loud in the pines and cedars dim,   Clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume;   And I with my comrades there in the night.   While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,                170   As to long panoramas of visions.   I saw askant the armies;   And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags;   Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierc'd with missiles, I         saw them,   And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody;   And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in         silence,)   And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.   I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,   And the white skeletons of young men--I saw them;   I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war;  180   But I saw they were not as was thought;   They themselves were fully at rest--they suffer'd not;   The living remain'd and suffer'd--the mother suffer'd,   And the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffer'd,   And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.   Passing the visions, passing the night;   Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands;   Passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my         soul,   (Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering         song,   As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding         the night,                                                  190   Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again         bursting with joy,   Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,   As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,)   Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves;   I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring,   I cease from my song for thee;   From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with         thee,   O comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night.   Yet each I keep, and all, retrievements out of the night;   The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,              200   And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,   With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of         woe,   With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor;   With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,   Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep--for         the dead I loved so well;   For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for         his dear sake;   Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,   There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.                            NIGHT on the prairies;   The supper is over--the fire on the ground burns low;   The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets:   I walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now I         never realized before.   Now I absorb immortality and peace,   I admire death, and test propositions.   How plenteous! How spiritual! How resumé!   The same Old Man and Soul--the same old aspirations, and the same         content.   I was thinking the day most splendid, till I saw what the not-day         exhibited,   I was thinking this globe enough, till there sprang out so noiseless         around me myriads of other globes.                           10   Now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, I will         measure myself by them;   And now, touch'd with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along         as those of the earth,   Or waiting to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the earth,   I henceforth no more ignore them, than I ignore my own life,   Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to         arrive.   O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me--as the day cannot,   I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.                            AN old man bending, I come, among new faces,   Years looking backward, resuming, in answer to children,   Come tell us, old man, as from young men and maidens that love me;   Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these         chances,   Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally         brave;)   Now be witness again--paint the mightiest armies of earth;   Of those armies so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?   What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,   Of hard-fought engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest         remains?   O maidens and young men I love, and that love me,                  10   What you ask of my days, those the strangest and sudden your talking         recalls;   Soldier alert I arrive, after a long march, cover'd with sweat and         dust;   In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the         rush of successful charge;   Enter the captur'd works.... yet lo! like a swift-running river, they         fade;   Pass and are gone, they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or         soldiers' joys;   (Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was         content.)   But in silence, in dreams' projections,   While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,   So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the         sand,   In nature's reverie sad, with hinged knees returning, I enter the         doors--(while for you up there,                              20   Whoever you are, follow me without noise, and be of strong heart.)   Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,   Straight and swift to my wounded I go,   Where they lie on the ground, after the battle brought in;   Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground;   Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital;   To the long rows of cots, up and down, each side, I return;   To each and all, one after another, I draw near--not one do I miss;   An attendant follows, holding a tray--he carries a refuse pail,   Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied and fill'd         again.                                                       30   I onward go, I stop,   With hinged knees and steady hand, to dress wounds;   I am firm with each--the pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable;   One turns to me his appealing eyes--(poor boy! I never knew you,   Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that         would save you.)   On, on I go!--(open doors of time! open hospital doors!)   The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand, tear not the bandage         away;)   The neck of the cavalry-man, with the bullet through and through, I         examine;   Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life         struggles hard;   (Come, sweet death! be persuaded, O beautiful death!               40   In mercy come quickly.)   From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,   I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and         blood;   Back on his pillow the soldier bends, with curv'd neck, and side-         falling head;   His eyes are closed, his face is pale, (he dares not look on the         bloody stump,   And has not yet look'd on it.)   I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep;   But a day or two more--for see, the frame all wasted already, and         sinking,   And the yellow-blue countenance see.   I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet wound,   50   Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so         offensive,   While the attendant stands behind aside me, holding the tray and         pail.   I am faithful, I do not give out;   The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,   These and more I dress with impassive hand--(yet deep in my breast a         fire, a burning flame.)   Thus in silence, in dreams' projections,   Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals;   The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,   I sit by the restless all the dark night--some are so young;   Some suffer so much--I recall the experience sweet and sad;        60   (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and         rested,   Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)                            MANHATTAN'S streets I saunter'd, pondering,   On time, space, reality--on such as these, and abreast with them,         prudence.   After all, the last explanation remains to be made about prudence;   Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that         suits immortality.   The Soul is of itself;   All verges to it--all has reference to what ensues;   All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence;   Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,         month, any part of the direct life-time, or the hour of death,         but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the         indirect life-time.   The indirect is just as much as the direct,   The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the         body, if not more.                                           10   Not one word or deed--not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of         the onanist, putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation,         cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution, but has         results beyond death, as really as before death.   Charity and personal force are the only investments worth anything.   No specification is necessary--all that a male or female does, that         is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or         her, in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the         whole scope of it forever.   Who has been wise, receives interest,   Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,         young, old, it is the same,   The interest will come round--all will come round.   Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever         affect all of the past, and all of the present, and all of the         future,   All the brave actions of war and peace,   All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,         young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn'd persons,   All furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves,         20   All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others         fill the seats of the boats,   All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a         friend's sake, or opinion's sake,   All pains of enthusiasts, scoff'd at by their neighbors,   All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,   All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,   All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we         inherit,   All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,         date, location,   All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,   All suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the divinity of his         mouth, or the shaping of his great hands;   All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe--         or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix'd stars,         by those there as we are here;                               30   All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you, whoever you are,         or by any one;   These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which         they sprang, or shall spring.   Did you guess anything lived only its moment?   The world does not so exist--no parts palpable or impalpable so         exist;   No consummation exists without being from some long previous         consummation--and that from some other,   Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the         beginning than any.   Whatever satisfies Souls is true;   Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of Souls;   Itself only finally satisfies the Soul;   The Soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson         but its own.                                                 40   Now I give you an inkling;   Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,         space, reality,   That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.   What is prudence, is indivisible,   Declines to separate one part of life from every part,   Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous, or the living from         the dead,   Matches every thought or act by its correlative,   Knows no possible forgiveness, or deputed atonement,   Knows that the young man who composedly peril'd his life and lost it,         has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,   That he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age in         riches and ease, has probably achiev'd nothing for himself         worth mentioning;                                            50   Knows that only that person has really learn'd, who has learn'd to         prefer results,   Who favors Body and Soul the same,   Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,   Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries or,         avoids death.                            BEHOLD this swarthy face--these gray eyes,   This beard--the white wool, unclipt upon my neck,   My brown hands, and the silent manner of me, without charm;   Yet comes one, a Manhattanese, and ever at parting, kisses me lightly         on the lips with robust love,   And I, on the crossing of the street, or on the ship's deck, give a         kiss in return;   We observe that salute of American comrades, land and sea,   We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.                                                 NOW finale to the shore!   Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!   Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)   Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,   Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,   Duly again to port, and hawser's tie, returning:   --But now obey, thy cherish'd, secret wish,   Embrace thy friends--leave all in order;   To port, and hawser's tie, no more returning,   Depart upon thy endless cruise, old Sailor!                        10                                                 Joy! shipmate--joy!   (Pleas'd to my Soul at death I cry;)   Our life is closed--our life begins;   The long, long anchorage we leave,   The ship is clear at last--she leaps!   She swiftly courses from the shore;   Joy! shipmate--joy!                            BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so much,   The mere fact, consciousness--these forms--the power of motion,   The least insect or animal--the senses--eyesight--love;   The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,   I have hardly gone, and hardly wish'd to go, any farther,   But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.                            AS the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,   A dread beyond, of I know not what, darkens me.   I shall go forth,   I shall traverse The States awhile--but I cannot tell whither or how         long;   Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing, my voice will         suddenly cease.   O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?   Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?... And yet it is         enough, O soul!   O soul! we have positively appear'd--that is enough.                            I WAS asking for something specific and perfect for my city,   Whereupon, lo! upsprang the aboriginal name!   Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly,         musical, self-sufficient;   I see that the word of my city is that word up there,   Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb, with         tall and wonderful spires,   Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and steamships--an         island sixteen miles long, solid-founded,   Numberless crowded streets--high growths of iron, slender, strong,         light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies;   Tide swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown,   The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger adjoining         islands, the heights, the villas,   The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the         ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model'd;            10   The down-town streets, the jobbers' houses of business--the houses of         business of the ship-merchants, and money-brokers--the river-         streets;   Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week;   The carts hauling goods--the manly race of drivers of horses--the         brown-faced sailors;   The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft;   The winter snows, the sleigh-bells--the broken ice in the river,         passing along, up or down, with the flood tide or ebb-tide;   The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form'd, beautiful-faced,         looking you straight in the eyes;   Trottoirs throng'd--vehicles--Broadway--the women--the shops and         shows,   The parades, processions, bugles playing, flags flying, drums         beating;   A million people--manners free and superb--open voices--hospitality--         the most courageous and friendly young men;   The free city! no slaves! no owners of slaves!                     20   The beautiful city, the city of hurried and sparkling waters! the         city of spires and masts!   The city nested in bays! my city!   The city of such women, I am mad to be with them! I will return after         death to be with them!   The city of such young men, I swear I cannot live happy, without I         often go talk, walk, eat, drink, sleep, with them!                                                 Come up from the fields, father, here's a letter from our Pete;    And come to the front door, mother-here's a letter from thy dear         son.   Lo, 'tis autumn;    Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,   Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the         moderate wind;    Where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd         vines;    (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?    Smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?)    Above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and         with wondrous clouds;    Below, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful-and the farm prospers         well.                                                        10   Down in the fields all prospers well;    But now from the fields come, father-come at the daughter's call;    And come to the entry, mother-to the front door come, right away.   Fast as she can she hurries-something ominous-her steps trembling;    She does not tarry to smoothe her hair, nor adjust her cap.   Open the envelope quickly;    O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd;    O a strange hand writes for our dear son-O stricken mother's soul!    All swims before her eyes-flashes with black-she catches the main         words only;    Sentences broken-gun-shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,         taken to hospital,                                           20   At present low, but will soon be better.   Ah, now, the single figure to me,   Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio, with all its cities and farms,   Sickly white in the face, and dull in the head, very faint,   By the jamb of a door leans.   Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through         her sobs;    The little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismay'd ;)    See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.   Alas, poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be         better, that brave and simple soul ;)    While they stand at home at the door, he is dead already;          30   The only son is dead.   But the mother needs to be better;    She, with thin form, presently drest in black;    By day her meals untouch'd-then at night fitfully sleeping, often         waking,   In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,   O that she might withdraw unnoticed-silent from life, escape and         withdraw,   To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.                            NOT alone those camps of white, O soldiers,   When, as order'd forward, after a long march,   Footsore and weary, soon as the light lessen'd, we halted for the         night;   Some of us so fatigued, carrying the gun and knapsack, dropping         asleep in our tracks;   Others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up began to         sparkle;   Outposts of pickets posted, surrounding, alert through the dark,   And a word provided for countersign, careful for safety;   Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the         drums,   We rose up refresh'd, the night and sleep pass'd over, and resumed         our journey,   Or proceeded to battle.                                            10   Lo! the camps of the tents of green,   Which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep         filling,   With a mystic army, (is it too order'd forward? is it too only         halting awhile,   Till night and sleep pass over?)   Now in those camps of green--in their tents dotting the world;   In the parents, children, husbands, wives, in them--in the old and         young,   Sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content         and silent there at last,   Behold the mighty bivouac-field, and waiting-camp of all,   Of corps and generals all, and the President over the corps and         generals all,   And of each of us, O soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we         fought,                                                      20   (There without hatred we shall all meet.)   For presently, O soldiers, we too camp in our place in the bivouac-         camps of green;   But we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign,   Nor drummer to beat the morning drum.                            COME, said the Muse,   Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,   Sing me the Universal.   In this broad Earth of ours,   Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,   Enclosed and safe within its central heart,   Nestles the seed Perfection.   By every life a share, or more or less,   None born but it is born--conceal'd or unconceal'd, the seed is         waiting.   Lo! keen-eyed, towering Science!                                   10   As from tall peaks the Modern overlooking,   Successive, absolute fiats issuing.   Yet again, lo! the Soul--above all science;   For it, has History gather'd like a husk around the globe;   For it, the entire star-myriads roll through the sky.   In spiral roads, by long detours,   (As a much-tacking ship upon the sea,)   For it, the partial to the permanent flowing,   For it, the Real to the Ideal tends.   For it, the mystic evolution;                                      20   Not the right only justified--what we call evil also justified.   Forth from their masks, no matter what,   From the huge, festering trunk--from craft and guile and tears,   Health to emerge, and joy--joy universal.   Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,   Out of the bad majority--the varied, countless frauds of men and         States,   Electric, antiseptic yet--cleaving, suffusing all,   Only the good is universal.   Over the mountain growths, disease and sorrow,   An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,                       30   High in the purer, happier air.   From imperfection's murkiest cloud,   Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,   One flash of Heaven's glory.   To fashion's, custom's discord,   To the mad Babel-din, the deafening orgies,   Soothing each lull, a strain is heard, just heard,   From some far shore, the final chorus sounding.   O the blest eyes! the happy hearts!   That see--that know the guiding thread so fine,                    40   Along the mighty labyrinth!   And thou, America!   For the Scheme's culmination--its Thought, and its Reality,   For these, (not for thyself,) Thou hast arrived.   Thou too surroundest all;   Embracing, carrying, welcoming all, Thou too, by pathways broad and         new,   To the Ideal tendest.   The measur'd faiths of other lands--the grandeurs of the past,   Are not for Thee--but grandeurs of Thine own;   Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,        50   All eligible to all.   All, all for Immortality!   Love, like the light, silently wrapping all!   Nature's amelioration blessing all!   The blossoms, fruits of ages--orchards divine and certain;   Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual Images ripening.   Give me, O God, to sing that thought!   Give me--give him or her I love, this quenchless faith   In Thy ensemble. Whatever else withheld, withhold not from us,   Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space;                 60   Health, peace, salvation universal.   Is it a dream?   Nay, but the lack of it the dream,   And, failing it, life's lore and wealth a dream,   And all the world a dream.                            O TO make the most jubilant poem!   Even to set off these, and merge with these, the carols of Death.   O full of music! full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!   Full of common employments! full of grain and trees.   O for the voices of animals! O for the swiftness and balance of         fishes!   O for the dropping of rain-drops in a poem!   O for the sunshine, and motion of waves in a poem.   O the joy of my spirit! it is uncaged! it darts like lightning!   It is not enough to have this globe, or a certain time--I will have         thousands of globes, and all time.   O the engineer's joys!                                             10   To go with a locomotive!   To hear the hiss of steam--the merry shriek--the steam-whistle--the         laughing locomotive!   To push with resistless way, and speed off in the distance.   O the gleesome saunter over fields and hill-sides!   The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds--the moist fresh         stillness of the woods,   The exquisite smell of the earth at day-break, and all through the         forenoon.   O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!   The saddle--the gallop--the pressure upon the seat--the cool gurgling         by the ears and hair.   O the fireman's joys!   I hear the alarm at dead of night,                                 20   I hear bells--shouts!--I pass the crowd--I run!   The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.   O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena, in         perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his         opponent.   O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human Soul         is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless         floods.   O the mother's joys!   The watching--the endurance--the precious love--the anguish--the         patiently yielded life.   O the joy of increase, growth, recuperation;   The joy of soothing and pacifying--the joy of concord and harmony.   O to go back to the place where I was born!   To hear the birds sing once more!                                  30   To ramble about the house and barn, and over the fields, once more,   And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.   O male and female!   O the presence of women! (I swear there is nothing more exquisite to         me than the mere presence of women;)   O for the girl, my mate! O for the happiness with my mate!   O the young man as I pass! O I am sick after the friendship of him         who, I fear, is indifferent to me.   O the streets of cities!   The flitting faces--the expressions, eyes, feet, costumes! O I cannot         tell how welcome they are to me.   O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the         coast!   O to continue and be employ'd there all my life!                   40   O the briny and damp smell--the shore--the salt weeds exposed at low         water,   The work of fishermen--the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher.   O it is I!   I come with my clam-rake and spade! I come with my eel-spear;   Is the tide out? I join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,   I laugh and work with them--I joke at my work, like a mettlesome         young man.   In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot         on the ice--I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice;   Behold me, well-clothed, going gaily, or returning in the afternoon--         my brood of tough boys accompaning me,   My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no one         else so well as they love to be with me,   By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.             50   Or, another time, in warm weather, out in a boat, to lift the         lobster-pots, where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know         the buoys;)   O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water, as I row,         just before sunrise, toward the buoys;   I pull the wicker pots up slantingly--the dark-green lobsters are         desperate with their claws, as I take them out--I insert wooden         pegs in the joints of their pincers,   I go to all the places, one after another, and then row back to the         shore,   There, in a huge kettle of boiling water, the lobsters shall be         boil'd till their color becomes scarlet.   Or, another time, mackerel-taking,   Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the         water for miles:   Or, another time, fishing for rock-fish, in Chesapeake Bay--I one of         the brown-faced crew:   Or, another time, trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with         braced body,   My left foot is on the gunwale--my right arm throws the coils of         slender rope,                                                60   In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my         companions.   O boating on the rivers!   The voyage down the Niagara, (the St. Lawrence,)--the superb         scenery--the steamers,   The ships sailing--the Thousand Islands--the occasional timber-raft,         and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,   The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook         their supper at evening.   O something pernicious and dread!   Something far away from a puny and pious life!   Something unproved! Something in a trance!   Something escaped from the anchorage, and driving free.   O to work in mines, or forging iron!                               70   Foundry casting--the foundry itself--the rude high roof--the ample         and shadow'd space,   The furnace--the hot liquid pour'd out and running.   O to resume the joys of the soldier:   To feel the presence of a brave general! to feel his sympathy!   To behold his calmness! to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!   To go to battle! to hear the bugles play, and the drums beat!   To hear the crash of artillery! to see the glittering of the bayonets         and musket-barrels in the sun!   To see men fall and die, and not complain!   To taste the savage taste of blood! to be so devilish!   To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.               80   O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!   I feel the ship's motion under me--I feel the Atlantic breezes         fanning me,   I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head--There--she blows!   --Again I spring up the rigging, to look with the rest--We see--we         descend, wild with excitement,   I leap in the lower'd boat--We row toward our prey, where he lies,   We approach, stealthy and silent--I see the mountainous mass,         lethargic, basking,   I see the harpooneer standing up--I see the weapon dart from his         vigorous arm:   O swift, again, now, far out in the ocean, the wounded whale,         settling, running to windward, tows me;   --Again I see him rise to breathe--We row close again,   I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the         wound,                                                       90   Again we back off--I see him settle again--the life is leaving him         fast,   As he rises, he spouts blood--I see him swim in circles narrower and         narrower, swiftly cutting the water--I see him die;   He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then         falls flat and still in the bloody foam.   O the old manhood of me, my joy!   My children and grand-children--my white hair and beard,   My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.   O the ripen'd joy of womanhood!   O perfect happiness at last!   I am more than eighty years of age--my hair, too, is pure white--I am         the most venerable mother;   How clear is my mind! how all people draw nigh to me!             100   What attractions are these, beyond any before? what bloom, more than         the bloom of youth?   What beauty is this that descends upon me, and rises out of me?   O the orator's joys!   To inflate the chest--to roll the thunder of the voice out from the         ribs and throat,   To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,   To lead America--to quell America with a great tongue.   O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself--receiving identity         through materials, and loving them--observing characters, and         absorbing them;   O my soul, vibrated back to me, from them--from facts, sight,         hearing, touch, my phrenology, reason, articulation,         comparison, memory, and the like;   The real life of my senses and flesh, transcending my senses and         flesh;   My body, done with materials--my sight, done with my material         eyes;                                                       110   Proved to me this day, beyond cavil, that it is not my material         eyes which finally see,   Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,         embraces, procreates.   O the farmer's joys!   Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,         Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys;   To rise at peep of day, and pass forth nimbly to work,   To plow land in the fall for winter-sown crops,   To plough land in the spring for maize,   To train orchards--to graft the trees--to gather apples in the fall.   O the pleasure with trees!   The orchard--the forest--the oak, cedar, pine, pekan-tree,        120   The honey-locust, black-walnut, cottonwood, and magnolia.   O Death! the voyage of Death!   The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,         for reasons;   Myself, discharging my excrementitious body, to be burn'd, or         render'd to powder, or buried,   My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,   My voided body, nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,         further offices, eternal uses of the earth.   O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore!   To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep--to race naked along the         shore.   O to realize space!   The plenteousness of all--that there are no bounds;               130   To emerge, and be of the sky--of the sun and moon, and the flying         clouds, as one with them.   O the joy of a manly self-hood!   Personality--to be servile to none--to defer to none--not to any         tyrant, known or unknown,   To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,   To look with calm gaze, or with a flashing eye,   To speak with a full and sonorous voice, out of a broad chest,   To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the         earth.   Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?   Joys of the dear companions, and of the merry word, and laughing         face?   Joys of the glad, light-beaming day--joy of the wide-breath'd         games?                                                      140   Joy of sweet music--joy of the lighted ball-room, and the dancers?   Joy of the friendly, plenteous dinner--the strong carouse, and         drinking?   Yet, O my soul supreme!   Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?   Joys of the free and lonesome heart--the tender, gloomy heart?   Joy of the solitary walk--the spirit bowed yet proud--the suffering         and the struggle?   The agonistic throes, the extasies--joys of the solemn musings, day         or night?   Joys of the thought of Death--the great spheres Time and Space?   Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals--the Divine Wife--the         sweet, eternal, perfect Comrade?   Joys all thine own, undying one--joys worthy thee, O Soul.        150   O, while I live, to be the ruler of life--not a slave,   To meet life as a powerful conqueror,   No fumes--no ennui--no more complaints, or scornful criticisms.   O me repellent and ugly!   To these proud laws of the air, the water, and the ground, proving my         interior Soul impregnable,   And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.   O to attract by more than attraction!   How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none of         the rest,   It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws.   O joy of suffering!                                               160   To struggle against great odds! to meet enemies undaunted!   To be entirely alone with them! to find how much one can stand!   To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face!   To mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect         nonchalance!   To be indeed a God!   O, to sail to sea in a ship!   To leave this steady, unendurable land!   To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the         houses;   To leave you, O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,   To sail, and sail, and sail!                                      170   O to have my life henceforth a poem of new joys!   To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on,   To be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports,   A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)   A swift and swelling ship, full of rich words--full of joys.                                                 Whoever you are, holding me now in hand,   Without one thing, all will be useless,   I give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,   I am not what you supposed, but far different.   Who is he that would become my follower?    Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?    The way is suspicious-the result uncertain, perhaps destructive;    You would have to give up all else-I alone would expect to be your         God, sole and exclusive,   Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,   The whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives         around you, would have to be abandon'd;                         Therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any further-Let         go your hand from my shoulders,   Put me down, and depart on your way.   Or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,   Or back of a rock, in the open air,   (For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not-nor in company,   And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)    But just possibly with you on a high hill-first watching lest any         person, for miles around, approach unawares,   Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or         some quiet island,   Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,   With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or the new husband's kiss,     For I am the new husband, and I am the comrade.   Or, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,   Where I may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip,   Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;    For thus, merely touching you, is enough-is best,   And thus, touching you, would I silently sleep and be carried         eternally.   But these leaves conning, you con at peril,   For these leaves, and me, you will not understand,   They will elude you at first, and still more afterward-I will         certainly elude you,   Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me,         behold!                                                        Already you see I have escaped from you.   For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this         book,   Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,   Nor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,   Nor will the candidates for my love, (unless at most a very few,)          prove victorious,   Nor will my poems do good only-they will do just as much evil,         perhaps more;    For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and         not hit-that which I hinted at;    Therefore release me, and depart on your way.                            GREAT are the myths--I too delight in them;   Great are Adam and Eve--I too look back and accept them;   Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women, sages,         inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests.   Great is Liberty! great is Equality! I am their follower;   Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where you sail, I sail,   I weather it out with you, or sink with you.   Great is Youth--equally great is Old Age--great are the Day and         Night;   Great is Wealth--great is Poverty--great is Expression--great is         Silence.   Youth, large, lusty, loving--Youth, full of grace, force,         fascination!   Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with equal grace, force,         fascination?                                                 10   Day, full-blown and splendid--Day of the immense sun, action,         ambition, laughter,   The Night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and         restoring darkness.   Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality;   But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowledge, pride,         enfolding love;   (Who goes for men and women showing Poverty richer than wealth?)   Expression of speech! in what is written or said, forget not that         Silence is also expressive,   That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as the         coldest, may be without words.   Great is the Earth, and the way it became what it is;   Do you imagine it has stopt at this? the increase abandon'd?   Understand then that it goes as far onward from this, as this is from         the times when it lay in covering waters and gases, before man         had appear'd.                                                20   Great is the quality of Truth in man;   The quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes,   It is inevitably in the man--he and it are in love, and never leave         each other.   The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight;   If there be any Soul, there is truth--if there be man or woman there         is truth--if there be physical or moral, there is truth;   If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth--if there be         things at all upon the earth, there is truth.   O truth of the earth! I am determin'd to press my way toward you;   Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after you.   Great is Language--it is the mightiest of the sciences,   It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, and of men         and women, and of all qualities and processes;               30   It is greater than wealth--it is greater than buildings, ships,         religions, paintings, music.   Great is the English speech--what speech is so great as the English?   Great is the English brood--what brood has so vast a destiny as the         English?   It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the new         rule;   The new rule shall rule as the Soul rules, and as the love, justice,         equality in the Soul rule.   Great is Law--great are the few old land-marks of the law,   They are the same in all times, and shall not be disturb'd.   Great is Justice!   Justice is not settled by legislators and laws--it is in the Soul;   It cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the         attraction of gravity, can;                                  40   It is immutable--it does not depend on majorities--majorities or what         not, come at last before the same passionless and exact         tribunal.   For justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judges--is it         in their Souls;   It is well assorted--they have not studied for nothing--the great         includes the less;   They rule on the highest grounds--they oversee all eras, states,         administrations.   The perfect judge fears nothing--he could go front to front before         God;   Before the perfect judge all shall stand back--life and death shall         stand back--heaven and hell shall stand back.   Great is Life, real and mystical, wherever and whoever;   Great is Death--sure as life holds all parts together, Death holds         all parts together.   Has Life much purport?--Ah, Death has the greatest purport.                            ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;   Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods, and from the         pond-side,   Breast-sorrel and pinks of love--fingers that wind around tighter         than vines,   Gushes from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of trees, as the         sun is risen;   Breezes of land and love--breezes set from living shores out to you         on the living sea--to you, O sailors!   Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd fresh to young         persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,   Love-buds, put before you and within you, whoever you are,   Buds to be unfolded on the old terms;   If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will open, and bring         form, color, perfume, to you;   If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become flowers,         fruits, tall blanches and trees.                             10                            AS I lay with my head in your lap, Camerado,   The confession I made I resume--what I said to you in the open air I         resume:   I know I am restless, and make others so;   I know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;   (Indeed I am myself the real soldier;   It is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the red-striped         artilleryman;)   For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle         them;   I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I could ever have         been had all accepted me;   I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions,         majorities, nor ridicule;   And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me;  10   And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;   ...Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and         still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,   Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.                            AS a strong bird on pinions free,   Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,   Such be the thought I'd think to-day of thee, America,   Such be the recitative I'd bring to-day for thee.   The conceits of the poets of other lands I bring thee not,   Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,   Nor rhyme--nor the classics--nor perfume of foreign court, or indoor         library;   But an odor I'd bring to-day as from forests of pine in the north, in         Maine--or breath of an Illinois prairie,   With open airs of Virginia, or Georgia, or Tennessee--or from Texas         uplands, or Florida's glades,   With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite;             10   And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea-sound,   That endlessly sounds from the two great seas of the world.   And for thy subtler sense, subtler refrains, O Union!   Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee--mind-formulas fitted         for thee--real, and sane, and large as these and thee;   Thou, mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew--thou         transcendental Union!   By thee Fact to be justified--blended with Thought;   Thought of Man justified--blended with God:   Through thy Idea--lo! the immortal Reality!   Through thy Reality--lo! the immortal Idea!   Brain of the New World! what a task is thine!                      20   To formulate the Modern.....Out of the peerless grandeur of the         modern,   Out of Thyself--comprising Science--to recast Poems, Churches, Art,   (Recast--may-be discard them, end them--May-be their work is done--         who knows?)   By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past,         the dead,   To limn, with absolute faith, the mighty living present.   (And yet, thou living, present brain! heir of the dead, the Old World         brain!   Thou that lay folded, like an unborn babe, within its folds so long!   Thou carefully prepared by it so long!--haply thou but unfoldest it--         only maturest it;   It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the by-gone time contain'd in         thee;   Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with         reference to thee,                                           30   The fruit of all the Old, ripening to-day in thee.)   Sail--sail thy best, ship of Democracy!   Of value is thy freight--'tis not the Present only,   The Past is also stored in thee!   Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone--not of thy western         continent alone;   Earth's résumé entire floats on thy keel, O ship--is steadied by thy         spars;   With thee Time voyages in trust--the antecedent nations sink or swim         with thee;   With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou         bear'st the other continents;   Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant:   --Steer, steer with good strong hand and wary eye, O helmsman--thou         carryest great companions,                                   40   Venerable, priestly Asia sails this day with thee,   And royal, feudal Europe sails with thee.   Beautiful World of new, superber Birth, that rises to my eyes,   Like a limitless golden cloud, filling the western sky;   Emblem of general Maternity, lifted above all;   Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons;   Out of thy teeming womb, thy giant babes in ceaseless procession         issuing,   Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength         and life;   World of the Real! world of the twain in one!   World of the Soul--born by the world of the real alone--led to         identity, body, by it alone;                                 50   Yet in beginning only--incalculable masses of composite, precious         materials,   By history's cycles forwarded--by every nation, language, hither         sent,   Ready, collected here--a freer, vast, electric World, to be         constructed here,   (The true New World--the world of orbic Science, Morals, Literatures         to come,)   Thou Wonder World, yet undefined, unform'd--neither do I define thee;   How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?   I feel thy ominous greatness, evil as well as good;   I watch thee, advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the         past;   I see thy light lighting and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire         globe;   But I do not undertake to define thee--hardly to comprehend thee;  60   I but thee name--thee prophecy--as now!   I merely thee ejaculate!   Thee in thy future;   Thee in thy only permanent life, career--thy own unloosen'd mind--thy         soaring spirit;   Thee as another equally needed sun, America--radiant, ablaze, swift-         moving, fructifying all;   Thee! risen in thy potent cheerfulness and joy--thy endless, great         hilarity!   (Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long--that weigh'd so         long upon the mind of man,   The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;)   Thee in thy larger, saner breeds of Female, Male--thee in thy         athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,   (To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,         endear'd alike, forever equal;)                              70   Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but certain;   Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization (until which thy proudest         material wealth and civilization must remain in vain;)   Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing Worship--thee in no single         bible, saviour, merely,   Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself--thy bibles incessant,         within thyself, equal to any, divine as any;   Thee in an education grown of thee--in teachers, studies, students,         born of thee;   Thee in thy democratic fetes, en masse--thy high original festivals,         operas, lecturers, preachers;   Thee in thy ultimata, (the preparations only now completed--the         edifice on sure foundations tied,)   Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought--thy topmost rational         joys--thy love, and godlike aspiration,   In thy resplendent coming literati--thy full-lung'd orators--thy         sacerdotal bards--kosmic savans,   These! these in thee, (certain to come,) to-day I prophecy.        80   Land tolerating all--accepting all--not for the good alone--all good         for thee;   Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself;   Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself.   (Lo! where arise three peerless stars,   To be thy natal stars, my country--Ensemble--Evolution--Freedom,   Set in the sky of Law.)   Land of unprecedented faith--God's faith!   Thy soil, thy very subsoil, all upheav'd;   The general inner earth, so long, so sedulously draped over, now and         hence for what it is, boldly laid bare,   Open'd by thee to heaven's light, for benefit or bale.             90   Not for success alone;   Not to fair-sail unintermitted always;   The storm shall dash thy face--the murk of war, and worse than war,         shall cover thee all over;   (Wert capable of war--its tug and trials? Be capable of peace, its         trials;   For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in peace--not         war;)   In many a smiling mask death shall approach, beguiling thee--thou in         disease shalt swelter;   The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy breasts,         seeking to strike thee deep within;   Consumption of the worst--moral consumption--shall rouge thy face         with hectic:   But thou shalt face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them         all,   Whatever they are to-day, and whatever through time they may be,  100   They each and all shall lift, and pass away, and cease from thee;   While thou, Time's spirals rounding--out of thyself, thyself still         extricating, fusing,   Equable, natural, mystical Union thou--(the mortal with immortal         blent,)   Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future--the spirit of the         body and the mind,   The Soul--its destinies.   The Soul, its destinies--the real real,   (Purport of all these apparitions of the real;)   In thee, America, the Soul, its destinies;   Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous!   By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd--(by these thyself         solidifying;)                                               110   Thou mental, moral orb! thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World!   The Present holds thee not--for such vast growth as thine--for such         unparallel'd flight as thine,   The Future only holds thee, and can hold thee.                            WITH its cloud of skirmishers in advance,   With now the sound of a single shot, snapping like a whip, and now an         irregular volley,   The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on;   Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,   In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,   With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,   As the army corps advances.                            OUT of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,   Whispering, I love you, before long I die,   I have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you,   For I could not die till I once look'd on you,   For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.   (Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe;   Return in peace to the ocean, my love;   I too am part of that ocean, my love--we are not so much separated;   Behold the great rondure--the cohesion of all, how perfect!   But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,    10   As for an hour, carrying us diverse--yet cannot carry us diverse for         ever;   Be not impatient--a little space--Know you, I salute the air, the         ocean and the land,   Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.)                                                    Tears! tears! tears!   In the night, in solitude, tears;   On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand;   Tears--not a star shining--all dark and desolate;   Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head:   --O who is that ghost?--that form in the dark, with tears?   What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?   Streaming tears--sobbing tears--throes, choked with wild cries;   O storm, embodied, rising, careering, with swift steps along the         beach;   O wild and dismal night storm, with wind! O belching and         desperate!                                                   10   O shade, so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and         regulated pace;   But away, at night, as you fly, none looking--O then the unloosen'd         ocean,   Of tears! tears! tears!                            A CALIFORNIA song!   A prophecy and indirection--a thought impalpable, to breathe, as air;   A chorus of dryads, fading, departing--or hamadryads departing;   A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,   Voice of a mighty dying tree in the Redwood forest dense.   Farewell, my brethren,   Farewell, O earth and sky--farewell, ye neighboring waters;   My time has ended, my term has come.   Along the northern coast,   Just back from the rock-bound shore, and the caves,                10   In the saline air from the sea, in the Mendocino country,   With the surge for bass and accompaniment low and hoarse,   With crackling blows of axes, sounding musically, driven by strong         arms,   Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes--there in the Redwood         forest dense,   I heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.   The choppers heard not--the camp shanties echoed not;   The quick-ear'd teamsters, and chain and jack-screw men, heard not,   As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years, to         join the refrain;   But in my soul I plainly heard.   Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,                                20   Down from its lofty top, rising two hundred feet high,   Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs--out of its foot-thick bark,   That chant of the seasons and time--chant, not of the past only, but         the future.   You untold life of me,   And all you venerable and innocent joys,   Perennial, hardy life of me, with joys, 'mid rain, and many a summer         sun,   And the white snows, and night, and the wild winds;   O the great patient, rugged joys! my soul's strong joys, unreck'd by         man;   (For know I bear the soul befitting me--I too have consciousness,         identity,   And all the rocks and mountains have--and all the earth;)          30   Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,   Our time, our term has come.   Nor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers,   We who have grandly fill'd our time;   With Nature's calm content, and tacit, huge delight,   We welcome what we wrought for through the past,   And leave the field for them.   For them predicted long,   For a superber Race--they too to grandly fill their time,   For them we abdicate--in them ourselves, ye forest kings!          40   In them these skies and airs--these mountain peaks--Shasta--Nevadas,   These huge, precipitous cliffs--this amplitude--these valleys grand--         Yosemite,   To be in them absorb'd, assimilated.   Then to a loftier strain,   Still prouder, more ecstatic, rose the chant,   As if the heirs, the Deities of the West,   Joining, with master-tongue, bore part.   Not wan from Asia's fetishes,   Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house,   (Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and         scaffolds every where,)                                      50   But come from Nature's long and harmless throes--peacefully builded         thence,   These virgin lands--Lands of the Western Shore,   To the new Culminating Man--to you, the Empire New,   You, promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate.   You occult, deep volitions,   You average Spiritual Manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself--         giving, not taking law,   You Womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and         love, and aught that comes from life and love,   You unseen Moral Essence of all the vast materials of America, (age         upon age, working in Death the same as Life,)   You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould         the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,   You hidden National Will, lying in your abysms, conceal'd, but ever         alert,                                                       60   You past and present purposes, tenaciously pursued, may-be         unconscious of yourselves,   Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;   You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts,         statutes, literatures,   Here build your homes for good--establish here--These areas entire,         Lands of the Western Shore,   We pledge, we dedicate to you.   For man of you--your characteristic Race,   Here may be hardy, sweet, gigantic grow--here tower, proportionate to         Nature,   Here climb the vast, pure spaces, unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or         roof,   Here laugh with storm or sun--here joy--here patiently inure,   Here heed himself, unfold himself (not others' formulas heed)--here         fill his time,                                               70   To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last,   To disappear, to serve.   Thus, on the northern coast,   In the echo of teamsters' calls, and the clinking chains, and the         music of choppers' axes,   The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the         groan,   Such words combined from the Redwood-tree--as of wood-spirits' voices         ecstatic, ancient and rustling,   The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,   All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,   From the Cascade range to the Wasatch--or Idaho far, or Utah,   To the deities of the Modern henceforth yielding,                  80   The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity--the         settlements, features all,   In the Mendocino woods I caught.   The flashing and golden pageant of California!   The sudden and gorgeous drama--the sunny and ample lands;   The long and varied stretch from Puget Sound to Colorado south;   Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air--valleys and mountain         cliffs;   The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow--the silent, cyclic         chemistry;   The slow and steady ages plodding--the unoccupied surface ripening--         the rich ores forming beneath;   At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,   A swarming and busy race settling and organizing every where;   Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the         whole world,                                                 90   To India and China and Australia, and the thousand island paradises         of the Pacific;   Populous cities--the latest inventions--the steamers on the rivers--         the railroads--with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,   And wool, and wheat, and the grape--and diggings of yellow gold.   But more in you than these, Lands of the Western Shore!   (These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)   I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years,         till now deferr'd,   Promis'd, to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the Race.   The New Society at last, proportionate to Nature,   In Man of you, more than your mountain peaks, or stalwart trees         imperial,                                                   100   In Woman more, far more, than all your gold, or vines, or even vital         air.   Fresh come, to a New World indeed, yet long prepared,   I see the Genius of the Modern, child of the Real and Ideal,   Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America, heir of the         past so grand,   To build a grander future.                            AS I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore,   As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead         that return no more,   A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;   Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America--         chant me the carol of victory;   And strike up the marches of Libertad--marches more powerful yet;   And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.   (Democracy--the destin'd conqueror--yet treacherous lip-smiles         everywhere,   And Death and infidelity at every step.)   A Nation announcing itself,   I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,       10   I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.   A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;   What we are, we are--nativity is answer enough to objections;   We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,   We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,   We are executive in ourselves--We are sufficient in the variety of         ourselves,   We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;   We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world;   From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.   Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,                      20   Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or         sinful in ourselves only.   (O mother! O sisters dear!   If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us;   It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)   Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme?   There can be any number of Supremes--One does not countervail         another, any more than one eyesight countervails another, or         one life countervails another.   All is eligible to all,   All is for individuals--All is for you,   No condition is prohibited--not God's, or any.   All comes by the body--only health puts you rapport with the         universe.                                                    30   Produce great persons, the rest follows.   America isolated I sing;   I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much         poison in The States.   (How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America?   For our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?)   Piety and conformity to them that like!   Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!   I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,   Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!   I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every         one I meet;                                                  40   Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?   Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?   (With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children!   These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)   O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?   If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to         me.   Fear grace--Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,   Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;   Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,   Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and         men.                                                         50   Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,   America brings builders, and brings its own styles.   The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and         pass'd to other spheres,   A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.   America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all         hazards,   Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound--initiates the true use of         precedents,   Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under         their forms,   Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne         from the house,   Perceives that it waits a little while in the door--that it was         fittest for its days,   That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who         approaches,                                                  60   And that he shall be fittest for his days.   Any period, one nation must lead,   One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.   These States are the amplest poem,   Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,   Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the         day and night,   Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,   Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul         loves,   Here the flowing trains--here the crowds, equality, diversity, the         Soul loves.   Land of lands, and bards to corroborate!                           70   Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred         face,   To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and         father's,   His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,   Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,   Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,   Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with         incomparable love,   Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,   Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in         him,   Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,   Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes--Columbia,         Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,        80   If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he         stretching with them north or south,   Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is         between them,   Growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar,         hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,         orange, magnolia,   Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,   He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with         northern transparent ice,   Off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,   Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-         hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle;   His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and         evil,   Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,   Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,  90   Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and         muscle,   The haughty defiance of the Year 1--war, peace, the formation of the         Constitution,   The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,   The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and         impregnable,   The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,         hunters, trappers;   Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the         gestation of new States,   Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up         from the uttermost parts;   Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially         the young men,   Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships--the gait they         have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the         presence of superiors,   The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and         decision of their phrenology,                               100   The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when         wrong'd,   The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,         good temper, and open-handedness--the whole composite make,   The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,   The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement         of the population,   The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,   Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all         points,   Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east,         north-west, south-west,   Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,   Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the         ruins of all the rest;   On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours be         the stake--and respite no more.                             110   (Lo! high toward heaven, this day,   Libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd,   I mark the new aureola around your head;   No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,   With war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,   And your port immovable where you stand;   With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted         fist,   And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly         crush'd beneath you;   The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his         senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;   --Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so         much!                                                       120   To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth!   An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)   Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive, and ever         keeps vista;   Others adorn the past--but you, O days of the present, I adorn you!   O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself for your         sake;   O America, because you build for mankind, I build for you!   O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with decision and         science,   I lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.   Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!   But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain,         pains, dismay, feebleness it is bequeathing.                130   I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,   I heard the voice arising, demanding bards;   By them, all native and grand--by them alone can The States be fused         into the compact organism of a Nation.   To hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no         account;   That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living         principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres         of plants.   Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of poetical         stuff, most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use         them the greatest;   Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their         poets shall.   (Soul of love, and tongue of fire!   Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!   --Ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides--yet how long barren,         barren?)                                                    140   Of These States, the poet is the equable man,   Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail         of their full returns,   Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,   He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither         more nor less,   He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,   He is the equalizer of his age and land,   He supplies what wants supplying--he checks what wants checking,   In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,         thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture,         arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health,         immortality, government;   In war, he is the best backer of the war--he fetches artillery as         good as the engineer's--he can make every word he speaks draw         blood;   The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady         faith,                                                      150   He is no argurer, he is judgment--(Nature accepts him absolutely;)   He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a         helpless thing;   As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,   His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,   In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,   He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,   He sees eternity in men and women--he does not see men and women as         dreams or dots.   For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,   For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,   The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign         despots.                                                    160   Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is Equality!   They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;   Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always         ready to fall for Liberty.   For the great Idea!   That, O my brethren--that is the mission of Poets.   Songs of stern defiance, ever ready,   Songs of the rapid arming, and the march,   The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know,   Warlike flag of the great Idea.   (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!                                 170   I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;   I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight--O the hard-         contested fight!   O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls         scream!   The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant         from the line;   Hark! the ringing word, Charge!--now the tussle, and the furious         maddening yells;   Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,   Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,   Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)   Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in         The States?   The place is august--the terms obdurate.                          180   Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and         mind,   He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe,         himself,   He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern         questions.   Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to America?   Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?   Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,         pride, freedom, friendship, of the land? its substratums and         objects?   Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first         year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners, ratified by         The States, and read by Washington at the head of the army?   Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?   Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,         and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?   Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the         bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, teach?       190   Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?   Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,         fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the         whole people?   Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?   Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to         life itself?   Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These States?   Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?   Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the         last-born? little and big? and for the errant?   What is this you bring my America?   Is it uniform with my country?   Is it not something that has been better told or done before?     200   Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?   Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause         in it?   Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,         literats, of enemies' lands?   Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?   Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?   Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the Union, in         that secession war?   Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?   Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air--to appear again in my         strength, gait, face?   Have real employments contributed to it? original makers--not mere         amanuenses?   Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face?    210   What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?         Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian,         native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?   Does it encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all         the men and women of the earth? (the genital impulse of These         States;)   Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians,         standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, Manhattanese,         western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy,         and in the promptness of their love?   Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,         each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,         infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of America?   What mocking and scornful negligence?   The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;   By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.   Rhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass         away,   The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes;   Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of         literature;                                                 220   America justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it,         or conceal from it--it is impassive enough,   Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,   If its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there         is no fear of mistake,   (The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country         absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)   He masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results         sweetest in the long run;   The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;   In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an         appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she         is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical         example.   Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the         streets,   People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive         knowers; There will shortly be no more priests--I say their         work is done,                                               230   Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies         here,   Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be         superb;   Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;   How dare you place anything before a man?   Fall behind me, States!   A man before all--myself, typical before all.   Give me the pay I have served for!   Give me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all the rest;   I have loved the earth, sun, animals--I have despised riches,   I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid         and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,           240   I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and         indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known         or unknown,   I have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the         young, and with the mothers of families,   I have read these leaves to myself in the open air--I have tried them         by trees, stars, rivers,   I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or defiled my Body,   I have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd         for others on the same terms,   I have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every         State;   (In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, America--sadly I         boast;   Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his         last;   This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,   To life recalling many a prostrate form:)                         250   --I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of         myself,   I reject none, I permit all.   (Say, O mother! have I not to your thought been faithful?   Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before me?)   I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things!   It is not the earth, it is not America, who is so great,   It is I who am great, or to be great--it is you up there, or any one;   It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,   Through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals.   Underneath all, individuals!                                      260   I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,   The American compact is altogether with individuals,   The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,   The whole theory of the universe is directed to one single         individual--namely, to You.   (Mother! with subtle sense severe--with the naked sword in your hand,   I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)   Underneath all, nativity,   I swear I will stand by my own nativity--pious or impious, so be it;   I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,   Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.    270   Underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and         women,   I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing         love for men and women,   After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and         women.   I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,   (Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners favor the         audacity and sublime turbulence of The States.)   Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,         ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,   Underneath all, to me is myself--to you, yourself--(the same         monotonous old song.)   O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you and me,   Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,   Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,    280   Its Congress is you and me--the officers, capitols, armies, ships,         are you and me,   Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,   The war--that war so bloody and grim--the war I will henceforth         forget--was you and me,   Natural and artificial are you and me,   Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,   Past, present, future, are you and me.   I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself,   Not any part of America, good or bad,   Not the promulgation of Liberty--not to cheer up slaves and horrify         foreign despots,   Not to build for that which builds for mankind,                   290   Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,   Not to justify science, nor the march of equality,   Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time.   I swear I am for those that have never been master'd!   For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,   For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.   I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth!   Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all.   I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things!   I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me!    300   I will make cities and civilizations defer to me!   This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount--and it I         teach again.   (Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,   I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children--saw in dreams         your dilating form;   Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)   I will confront these shows of the day and night!   I will know if I am to be less than they!   I will see if I am not as majestic as they!   I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they!   I will see if I am to be less generous than they!                 310   I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have         meaning!   I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,         and I am not to be enough for myself.   I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains,         brutes,   Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and become the master         myself.   America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except         myself?   These States--what are they except myself?   I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked--it is for my         sake,   I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms.   (Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!   I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for;     320   I know not fruition's success--but I know that through war and peace         your work goes on, and must yet go on.)   .... Thus, by blue Ontario's shore,   While the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me,   I thrill'd with the Power's pulsations--and the charm of my theme was         upon me,   Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me.   And I saw the free Souls of poets;   The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,   Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.   O my rapt verse, my call--mock me not!   Not for the bards of the past--not to invoke them have I launch'd you         forth,                                                      330   Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,   Have I sung so capricious and loud, my savage song.   Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;   (For the war, the war is over--the field is clear'd,)   Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,   To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul.   Bards grand as these days so grand!   Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the         war, the war is over!)   Yet Bards of the latent armies--a million soldiers waiting, ever-         ready,   Bards towering like hills--(no more these dots, these pigmies, these         little piping straws, these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass         for poets;)                                                 340   Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd         stripes!   Ample Ohio's bards--bards for California! inland bards--bards of the         war;)   (As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turning finally on         the war;)   Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping         eagle's scream!   You, by my charm, I invoke!                            WHAT ship, puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?   Or, coming in, to avoid the bars, and follow the channel, a perfect         pilot needs?   Here, sailor! Here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,   Whom, in a little boat, putting off, and rowing, I, hailing you,         offer.                            OF him I love day and night, I dream'd I heard he was dead;   And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love--but he was not         in that place;   And I dream'd I wander'd, searching among burial-places, to find him;   And I found that every place was a burial-place;   The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is         now;)   The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,         Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead         as of the living,   And fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living;   --And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,   And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd;   And now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with         them;                                                        10   And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently         everywhere, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be         satisfied;   And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly         render'd to powder, and pour'd in the sea, I shall be         satisfied;   Or if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be satisfied.                            LOOK down, fair moon, and bathe this scene;   Pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen,         purple;   On the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide,   Pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon.                            AS I walk these broad, majestic days of peace,   (For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific         Ideal!   Against vast odds, having gloriously won,   Now thou stridest on--yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,   Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,   Longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all others;   --As I walk solitary, unattended,   Around me I hear that eclat of the world--politics, produce,   The announcements of recognized things--science,   The approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions.       10   I see the ships, (they will last a few years,)   The vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,   And here the indorsement of all, and do not object to it.   But I too announce solid things;   Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing--I watch         them,   Like a grand procession, to music of distant bugles, pouring,         triumphantly moving--and grander heaving in sight;   They stand for realities--all is as it should be.   Then my realities;   What else is so real as mine?   Libertad, and the divine average--Freedom to every slave on the face         of the earth,                                                20   The rapt promises and luminé of seers--the spiritual world--these         centuries lasting songs,   And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements         of any.   For we support all, fuse all,   After the rest is done and gone, we remain;   There is no final reliance but upon us;   Democracy rests finally upon us (I, my brethren, begin it,)   And our visions sweep through eternity.                                                 O SUN of real peace! O hastening light!   O free and extatic! O what I here, preparing, warble for!   O the sun of the world will ascend, dazzling, and take his height--         and you too, O my Ideal, will surely ascend!   O so amazing and broad--up there resplendent, darting and burning!   O vision prophetic, stagger'd with weight of light! with pouring         glories!   O lips of my soul, already becoming powerless!   O ample and grand Presidentiads! Now the war, the war is over!   New history! new heroes! I project you!   Visions of poets! only you really last! sweep on! sweep on!   O heights too swift and dizzy yet!                                 10   O purged and luminous! you threaten me more than I can stand!   (I must not venture--the ground under my feet menaces me--it will not         support me:   O future too immense,)--O present, I return, while yet I may, to you.                            AS Adam, early in the morning,   Walking forth from the bower, refresh'd with sleep;   Behold me where I pass--hear my voice--approach,   Touch me--touch the palm of your hand to my Body as I pass;   Be not afraid of my Body.                            SPONTANEOUS me, Nature,   The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am happy with,   The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,   The hill-side whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain ash,   The same, late in autumn--the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple, and         light and dark green,   The rich coverlid of the grass--animals and birds--the private         untrimm'd bank--the primitive apples--the pebble-stones,   Beautiful dripping fragments--the negligent list of one after         another, as I happen to call them to me, or think of them,   The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,)   The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me,   This poem, drooping shy and unseen, that I always carry, and that all         men carry,                                                   10   (Know, once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like me, are         our lusty, lurking, masculine poems;)   Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding, love-climbers,         and the climbing sap,   Arms and hands of love--lips of love--phallic thumb of love--breasts         of love--bellies press'd and glued together with love,   Earth of chaste love--life that is only life after love,   The body of my love--the body of the woman I love--the body of the         man--the body of the earth,   Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west,   The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and down--that gripes         the full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her with amorous firm         legs, takes his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and         tight till he is satisfied,   The wet of woods through the early hours,   Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with an         arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,   The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage-plant, mint, birch-         bark,                                                        20   The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what         he was dreaming,   The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl, and falling still and         content to the ground,   The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,   The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any         one,    The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged         feelers may be intimate where they are,   The curious roamer, the hand, roaming all over the body--the bashful         withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and         edge themselves,   The limpid liquid within the young man,   The vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful,   The torment--the irritable tide that will not be at rest,   The like of the same I feel--the like of the same in others,       30   The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that         flushes and flushes,   The young man that wakes, deep at night, the hot hand seeking to         repress what would master him;   The mystic amorous night--the strange half-welcome pangs, visions,         sweats,   The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers--         the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry;   The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,   The merriment of the twin-babes that crawl over the grass in the sun,         the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,   The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen'd long-         round walnuts;   The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,   The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent,         while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves         indecent;   The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of         maternity,                                                   40   The oath of procreation I have sworn--my Adamic and fresh daughters,   The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I         saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am         through,   The wholesome relief, repose, content;   And this bunch, pluck'd at random from myself;   It has done its work--I tossed it carelessly to fall where it may.                            HOW they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals;)   How dear and dreadful they are to the earth;   How they inure to themselves as much as to any--What a paradox         appears their age;   How people respond to them, yet know them not;   How there is something relentless in their fate, all times;   How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,   And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same         great purchase.                                                 PRIMEVAL my love for the woman I love,   O bride! O wife! more resistless, more enduring than I can tell, the         thought of you!   Then separate, as disembodied, the purest born,   The ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,   I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,   O sharer of my roving life.                            POETS to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!   Not to-day is to justify me, and answer what I am for;   But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than         before known,   Arouse! Arouse--for you must justify me--you must answer.   I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,   I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.   I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a         casual look upon you, and then averts his face,   Leaving it to you to prove and define it,   Expecting the main things from you.                            FLOOD-TIDE below me! I watch you face to face;   Clouds of the west! sun there half an hour high! I see you also face         to face.   Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes! how curious         you are to me!   On the ferry-boats, the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning         home, are more curious to me than you suppose;   And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence, are more to         me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.   The impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the         day;   The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme--myself disintegrated, every         one disintegrated, yet part of the scheme:   The similitudes of the past, and those of the future;   The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings--on         the walk in the street, and the passage over the river;   The current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away;     10   The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them;   The certainty of others--the life, love, sight, hearing of others.   Others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to         shore;   Others will watch the run of the flood-tide;   Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the         heights of Brooklyn to the south and east;   Others will see the islands large and small;   Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half         an hour high;   A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others         will see them,   Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring in of the flood-tide, the falling         back to the sea of the ebb-tide.   It avails not, neither time or place--distance avails not;         20   I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many         generations hence;   I project myself--also I return--I am with you, and know how it is.   Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt;   Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd;   Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the bright         flow, I was refresh'd;   Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift         current, I stood, yet was hurried;   Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the thick-         stem'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.   I too many and many a time cross'd the river, the sun half an hour         high;   I watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls--I saw them high in the air,         floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,   I saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and         left the rest in strong shadow,                              30   I saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the         south.   I too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,   Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,   Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light around the shape of my         head in the sun-lit water,   Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,   Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,   Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,   Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,   Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops--saw the ships at anchor,   The sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars,      40   The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender         serpentine pennants,   The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-         houses,   The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the         wheels,   The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sun-set,   The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the         frolicsome crests and glistening,   The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the         granite store-houses by the docks,   On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on         each side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,   On the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning         high and glaringly into the night,   Casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow         light, over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of         streets.   These, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you;       50   I project myself a moment to tell you--also I return.   I loved well those cities;   I loved well the stately and rapid river;   The men and women I saw were all near to me;   Others the same--others who look back on me, because I look'd forward         to them;   (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)   What is it, then, between us?   What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?   Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails         not.   I too lived--Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine;                   60   I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the         waters around it;   I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,   In the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,   In my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my bed, they came upon         me.   I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution;   I too had receiv'd identity by my Body;   That I was, I knew was of my body--and what I should be, I knew I         should be of my body.   It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,   The dark threw patches down upon me also;   The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious;             70   My great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they not in reality         meagre? would not people laugh at me?   It is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;   I am he who knew what it was to be evil;   I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,   Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,   Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,   Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant;   The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,   The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not         wanting,   Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these         wanting.                                                     80   But I was Manhattanese, friendly and proud!   I was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as         they saw me approaching or passing,   Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of         their flesh against me as I sat,   Saw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly,         yet never told them a word,   Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,         sleeping,   Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,   The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we         like,   Or as small as we like, or both great and small.   Closer yet I approach you;   What thought you have of me, I had as much of you--I laid in my         stores in advance;                                           90   I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.   Who was to know what should come home to me?   Who knows but I am enjoying this?   Who knows but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot         see me?   It is not you alone, nor I alone;   Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;   It is that each came, or comes, or shall come, from its due emission,   From the general centre of all, and forming a part of all:   Everything indicates--the smallest does, and the largest does;   A necessary film envelopes all, and envelopes the Soul for a proper         time.                                                       100   Now I am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to         me than my mast-hemm'd Manhattan,   My river and sun-set, and my scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide,   The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight,         and the belated lighter;   Curious what Gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and         with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest         name as I approach;   Curious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or         man that looks in my face,   Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you.   We understand, then, do we not?   What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?   What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not         accomplish, is accomplish'd, is it not?   What the push of reading could not start, is started by me         personally, is it not?                                      110   Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!   Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!   Gorgeous clouds of the sun-set! drench with your splendor me, or the         men and women generations after me;   Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!   Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!--stand up, beautiful hills of         Brooklyn!   Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!   Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!   Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public         assembly!   Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my         nighest name!   Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or         actress!                                                    120   Play the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one         makes it!   Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be         looking upon you;   Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet         haste with the hasting current;   Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in         the air;   Receive the summer sky, you water! and faithfully hold it, till all         downcast eyes have time to take it from you;   Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any         one's head, in the sun-lit water;   Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd         schooners, sloops, lighters!   Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset;   Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at         nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the         houses;   Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are;            130   You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul;   About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest         aromas;   Thrive, cities! bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and         sufficient rivers;   Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual;   Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.   We descend upon you and all things--we arrest you all;   We realize the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids;   Through you color, form, location, sublimity, ideality;   Through you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and         determinations of ourselves.   You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers! you         novices!                                                    140   We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate         henceforward;   Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves         from us;   We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently         within us;   We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also;   You furnish your parts toward eternity;   Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.                                                 SO far, and so far, and on toward the end,   Singing what is sung in this book, from the irresistible impulses of         me;   But whether I continue beyond this book, to maturity,   Whether I shall dart forth the true rays, the ones that wait unfired,   (Did you think the sun was shining its brightest?   No--it has not yet fully risen;)   Whether I shall complete what is here started,   Whether I shall attain my own height, to justify these, yet         unfinished,   Whether I shall make THE POEM OF THE NEW WORLD, transcending all         others--depends, rich persons, upon you,   Depends, whoever you are now filling the current Presidentiad, upon         you,                                                         10   Upon you, Governor, Mayor, Congressman,   And you, contemporary America.Whitman, Walt. 1900. Leaves of Grass.                            I WAS looking a long while for a clue to the history of the past for         myself, and for these chants--and now I have found it;   It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither         accept nor reject;)   It is no more in the legends than in all else;   It is in the present--it is this earth to-day;   It is in Democracy--(the purport and aim of all the past;)   It is the life of one man or one woman to-day--the average man of         to-day;   It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts;   It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery,         politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of         nations,   All for the average man of to-day.                            FULL of life, now, compact, visible,   I, forty years old the Eighty-third Year of The States,   To one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,   To you, yet unborn, these, seeking you.   When you read these, I, that was visible, am become invisible;   Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me;   Fancying how happy you were, if I could be with you, and become your         comrade;   Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now with         you.)                                                 THERE are who teach only the sweet lessons of peace and safety;   But I teach lessons of war and death to those I love,   That they readily meet invasions, when they come.                            AS if a phantom caress'd me,   I thought I was not alone, walking here by the shore;   But the one I thought was with me, as now I walk by the shore--the         one I loved, that caress'd me,   As I lean and look through the glimmering light--that one has utterly         disappear'd,   And those appear that are hateful to me, and mock me.                                                 Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun  by my side. The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the  sparkle and scud,My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout  joyously from the deck. The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me, I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;You should have been with us that day round the chowder- kettle.I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far  west, the bride was a red girl,Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly  smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large  thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins,  his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held  his bride by the hand,She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight  locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd  to her feet.The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside, I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile, Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured  him,And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and  bruis'd feet,And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave  him some coarse clean clothes,And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his  awkwardness,And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and  ankles;He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and  pass'd north,I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the  corner.                            FAR hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,   Crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,   Once a queen--now lean and tatter'd, seated on the ground,   Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders;   At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,   Long silent--she too long silent--mourning her shrouded hope and         heir;   Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of         love.   Yet a word, ancient mother;   You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead         between your knees;   O you need not sit there, veil'd in your old white hair, so         dishevel'd;                                                  10   For know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave;   It was an illusion--the heir, the son you love, was not really dead;   The Lord is not dead--he is risen again, young and strong, in another         country;   Even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,   What you wept for, was translated, pass'd from the grave,   The winds favor'd, and the sea sail'd it,   And now with rosy and new blood,   Moves to-day in a new country.                            SPLENDOR of ended day, floating and filling me!   Hour prophetic--hour resuming the past!   Inflating my throat--you, divine average!   You, Earth and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.   Open mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,   Eyes of my Soul, seeing perfection,   Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;   Corroborating forever the triumph of things.   Illustrious every one!   Illustrious what we name space--sphere of unnumber'd spirits;      10   Illustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, even the tiniest         insect;   Illustrious the attribute of speech--the senses--the body;   Illustrious the passing light! Illustrious the pale reflection on the         new moon in the western sky!   Illustrious whatever I see, or hear, or touch, to the last.   Good in all,   In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,   In the annual return of the seasons,   In the hilarity of youth,   In the strength and flush of manhood,   In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,                      20   In the superb vistas of Death.   Wonderful to depart;   Wonderful to be here!   The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood!   To breathe the air, how delicious!   To speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand!   To prepare for sleep, for bed--to look on my rose-color'd flesh;   To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large;   To be this incredible God I am;   To have gone forth among other Gods--these men and women I love. 30   Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself!   How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!   How the clouds pass silently overhead!   How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on         and on!   How the water sports and sings! (Surely it is alive!)   How the trees rise and stand up--with strong trunks--with branches         and leaves!   (Surely there is something more in each of the tree--some living         Soul.)   O amazement of things! even the least particle!   O spirituality of things!   O strain musical, flowing through ages and continents--now reaching         me and America!                                              40   I take your strong chords--I intersperse them, and cheerfully pass         them forward.   I too carol the sun, usher'd, or at noon, or, as now, setting,   I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and of all the         growths of the earth,   I too have felt the resistless call of myself.   As I sail'd down the Mississippi,   As I wander'd over the prairies,   As I have lived--As I have look'd through my windows, my eyes,   As I went forth in the morning--As I beheld the light breaking in the         east;   As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach         of the Western Sea;   As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago--whatever streets I have         roam'd;                                                      50   Or cities, or silent woods, or peace, or even amid the sights of war;   Wherever I have been, I have charged myself with contentment and         triumph.   I sing the Equalities, modern or old,   I sing the endless finales of things;   I say Nature continues--Glory continues;   I praise with electric voice;   For I do not see one imperfection in the universe;   And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the         universe.   O setting sun! though the time has come,   I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated         adoration.                                                  60                            DESPAIRING cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,   The sad voice of Death--the call of my nearest lover, putting forth,         alarmed, uncertain,   This sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,   Come tell me where I am speeding--tell me my destination.   I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,   I approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,         your mute inquiry,   Whither I go from the bed I now recline on, come tell me;   Old age, alarmed, uncertain--A young woman's voice appealing to me,         for comfort,   A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?                            I SAW in Louisiana a live-oak growing,   All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches;   Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous leaves of dark         green,   And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself;   But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, standing alone         there, without its friend, its lover near--for I knew I could         not;   And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and         twined around it a little moss,   And brought it away--and I have placed it in sight in my room;   It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,   (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them;)   Yet it remains to me a curious token--it makes me think of manly         love;                                                        10   For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana,         solitary, in a wide flat space,   Uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a lover, near,   I know very well I could not.                                                 I THOUGHT I was not alone, walking here by the shore,   But the one I thought was with me, as now I walk by the shore,   As I lean and look through the glimmering light--that one has utterly         disappeared,   And those appear that perplex me.                                                 I WILL take an egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard,   I will take a branch of gooseberries from the old bush in the garden,         and go and preach to the world;   You shall see I will not meet a single heretic or scorner,   You shall see how I stump clergymen, and confound them,   You shall see me showing a scarlet tomato, and a white pebble from         the beach.                            ONE song, America, before I go,   I'd sing, o'er all the rest, with trumpet sound,   For thee--the Future.   I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality;   I'd fashion thy Ensemble, including Body and Soul;   I'd show, away ahead, thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd.   (The paths to the House I seek to make,   But leave to those to come, the House itself.)   Belief I sing--and Preparation;   As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the Present         only,                                                        10   But greater still from what is yet to come,   Out of that formula for Thee I sing.                                                 WHAT are those of the known, but to ascend and enter the Unknown?   And what are those of life, but for Death?                            HOW solemn, as one by one,   As the ranks returning, all worn and sweaty--as the men file by where         I stand;   As the faces, the masks appear--as I glance at the faces, studying         the masks;   (As I glance upward out of this page, studying you, dear friend,         whoever you are;)   How solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks,         and to you;   I see behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul;   O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,   Nor the bayonet stab what you really are:   ... The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,   Waiting, secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,   Nor the bayonet stab, O friend!                                    10                                                 Come, said my soul, Such verses for my body let us write, (For we are One),That should I after death invisibly return,Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,There to some group of mates the chants resuming,(Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultous waves,)Ever with pleas'd smile I may keep on Ever and ever to the verses owning - as, first, I here and now,Signing for soul and body, set them to my name,Walt Whitman.                            AMONG the men and women, the multitude,   I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,   Acknowledging none else--not parent, wife, husband, brother, child,         any nearer than I am;   Some are baffled--But that one is not--that one knows me.   Ah, lover and perfect equal!   I meant that you should discover me so, by my faint indirections;   And I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the like in you.                                                 AT the last, tenderly, From the walls of the powerful, fortress'd house, From the clasp of the knitted locks--from the keep of the well-closed doors, Let me be wafted. Let me glide noiselessly forth; With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper Set ope the doors, O soul! Tenderly! be not impatient! (Strong is your hold, O mortal flesh! Strong is your hold, O love!)                            AH poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats!   Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me!   (For what is my life, or any man's life, but a conflict with foes--         the old, the incessant war?)   You degradations--you tussle with passions and appetites;   You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds, the sharpest of         all;)   You toil of painful and choked articulations--you meannesses;   You shallow tongue-talks at tables, (my tongue the shallowest of         any;)   You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smother'd ennuis;   Ah, think not you finally triumph--My real self has yet to come         forth;   It shall yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies beneath me;  10   It shall yet stand up the soldier of unquestion'd victory.                                                 HE is wisest who has the most caution,   He only wins who goes far enough.   Any thing is as good as established, when that is established that         will produce it and continue it.                                                 AN old man's thought of School;   An old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself         cannot.   Now only do I know you!   O fair auroral skies! O morning dew upon the grass!   And these I see--these sparkling eyes,   These stores of mystic meaning--these young lives,   Building, equipping, like a fleet of ships--immortal ships!   Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,   On the Soul's voyage.   Only a lot of boys and girls?                                      10   Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?   Only a Public School?   Ah more--infinitely more;   (As George Fox rais'd his warning cry, "Is it this pile of brick and         mortar--these dead floors, windows, rails--you call the church?   Why this is not the church at all--the Church is living, ever living         Souls.")   And you, America,   Cast you the real reckoning for your present?   The lights and shadows of your future--good or evil?   To girlhood, boyhood look--the Teacher and the School.                            AS I watch'd the ploughman ploughing,   Or the sower sowing in the fields--or the harvester harvesting,   I saw there too, O life and death, your analogies:   (Life, life is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.)                            AGES and ages, returning at intervals,   Undestroy'd, wandering immortal,   Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly sweet,   I, chanter of Adamic songs,   Through the new garden, the West, the great cities calling,   Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these, offering         myself,   Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex,   Offspring of my loins.                            SAUNTERING the pavement, or riding the country by-road--lo! such         faces!   Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality;   The spiritual, prescient face--the always welcome, common, benevolent         face,   The face of the singing of music--the grand faces of natural lawyers         and judges, broad at the back-top;   The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the brows--the shaved         blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens;   The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face;   The ugly face of some beautiful Soul, the handsome detested or         despised face;   The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of         many children;   The face of an amour, the face of veneration;   The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock;              10   The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face;   A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper;   A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the         gelder.   Sauntering the pavement, thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry,         faces, and faces, and faces:   I see them, and complain not, and am content with all.   Do you suppose I could be content with all, if I thought them their         own finale?   This now is too lamentable a face for a man;   Some abject louse, asking leave to be--cringing for it;   Some milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.   This face is a dog's snout, sniffing for garbage;                  20   Snakes nest in that mouth--I hear the sibilant threat.   This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea;   Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.   This is a face of bitter herbs--this an emetic--they need no label;   And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.   This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly         cry,   Its veins down the neck distended, its eyes roll till they show         nothing but their whites,   Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn'd-in         nails,   The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground while he         speculates well.   This face is bitten by vermin and worms,                           30   And this is some murderer's knife, with a half-pull'd scabbard.   This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee;   An unceasing death-bell tolls there.   Those then are really men--the bosses and tufts of the great round         globe!   Features of my equals, would you trick me with your creas'd and         cadaverous march?   Well, you cannot trick me.   I see your rounded, never-erased flow;   I see neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.   Splay and twist as you like--poke with the tangling fores of fishes         or rats;   You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.                           40   I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had at         the asylum;   And I knew for my consolation what they knew not;   I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,   The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement;   And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,   And I shall meet the real landlord, perfect and unharm'd, every inch         as good as myself.   The Lord advances, and yet advances;   Always the shadow in front--always the reach'd hand bringing up the         laggards.   Out of this face emerge banners and horses--O superb! I see what is         coming;   I see the high pioneer-caps--I see the staves of runners clearing the         way,                                                         50   I hear victorious drums.   This face is a life-boat;   This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest;   This face is flavor'd fruit, ready for eating;   This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.   These faces bear testimony, slumbering or awake;   They show their descent from the Master himself.   Off the word I have spoken, I except not one--red, white, black, are         all deific;   In each house is the ovum--it comes forth after a thousand years.   Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me;                  60   Tall and sufficient stand behind, and make signs to me;   I read the promise, and patiently wait.   This is a full-grown lily's face,   She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets,   Come here, she blushingly cries--Come nigh to me, limber-hipp'd man,   Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,   Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,   Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and shoulders.   The old face of the mother of many children!   Whist! I am fully content.                                         70   Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,   It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,   It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry, and the cat-brier         under them.   I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,   I heard what the singers were singing so long,   Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-         blue,   Behold a woman!   She looks out from her quaker cap--her face is clearer and more         beautiful than the sky.   She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,   The sun just shines on her old white head.                         80   Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,   Her grandsons raised the flax, and her granddaughters spun it with         the distaff and the wheel.   The melodious character of the earth,   The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not wish to         go,   The justified mother of men.                            THAT shadow, my likeness, that goes to and fro, seeking a livelihood,         chattering, chaffering;   How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits;   How often I question and doubt whether that is really me;   --But in these, and among my lovers, and caroling my songs,   O I never doubt whether that is really me.                            AMERICA always!

all so dear to me--what you are, (whatever it is,) I become         a part of that, whatever it is;   Southward there, I screaming, with wings slowly flapping, with the         myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida--or in         Louisiana, with pelicans breeding;   Otherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande,         the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the         Saskatchawan, or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing         and skipping and running;                                    70   Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I, with         parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and         aquatic plants;   Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the         crow with its bill, for amusement--And I triumphantly         twittering;   The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh         themselves--the body of the flock feed--the sentinels outside         move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to         time reliev'd by other sentinels--And I feeding and taking         turns with the rest;   In Kanadian forests, the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,         rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his         fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--And I, plunging at the         hunters, corner'd and desperate;   In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the         countless workmen working in the shops,   And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself         than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,   Singing the song of These, my ever united lands--my body no more         inevitably united, part to part, and made one identity, any         more than my lands are inevitably united, and made ONE         IDENTITY;   Nativities, climates, the grass of the great Pastoral Plains;   Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these         me,   These affording, in all their particulars, endless feuillage to me         and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the         union of them, to afford the like to you?                    80   Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also         be eligible as I am?   How can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect         bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of These States?                            AS I ponder'd in silence,   Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,   A Phantom arose before me, with distrustful aspect,   Terrible in beauty, age, and power,   The genius of poets of old lands,   As to me directing like flame its eyes,   With finger pointing to many immortal songs,   And menacing voice, What singest thou? it said;   Know'st thou not, there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?   And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,              10   The making of perfect soldiers?   Be it so, then I answer'd,   I too, haughty Shade, also sing war--and a longer and greater one         than any,   Waged in my book with varying fortune--with flight, advance, and         retreat--Victory deferr'd and wavering,   (Yet, methinks, certain, or as good as certain, at the last,)--The         field the world;   For life and death--for the Body, and for the eternal Soul,   Lo! too am come, chanting the chant of battles,   I, above all, promote brave soldiers.                            SOMETIMES with one I love, I fill myself with rage, for fear I effuse         unreturn'd love;   But now I think there is no unreturn'd love--the pay is certain, one         way or another;   (I loved a certain person ardently, and my love was not return'd;   Yet out of that, I have written these songs.)                                                 Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly; Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.Which of the young men does she like the best? Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long hair,Little streams pass'd over their bodies.An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,It descended trembling from their temples and ribs.The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,They do not know who puffs and declines with the pendant and bending arch,They do not think whom they souse with spray.                                                 ON the beach, at night,   Stands a child, with her father,   Watching the east, the autumn sky.   Up through the darkness,   While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,   Lower, sullen and fast, athwart and down the sky,   Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,   Ascends, large and calm, the lord-star Jupiter;    And nigh at hand, only a very little above,   Swim the delicate brothers, the Pleiades.                          10   From the beach, the child, holding the hand of her father,   Those burial-clouds that lower, victorious, soon to devour all,   Watching, silently weeps.   Weep not, child,   Weep not, my darling,   With these kisses let me remove your tears;    The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,   They shall not long possess the sky- shall devour the stars only in         apparition:   Jupiter shall emerge- be patient- watch again another night- the         Pleiades shall emerge,   They are immortal- all those stars, both silvery and golden, shall         shine out again,                                             20   The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again- they         endure;    The vast immortal suns, and the long-enduring pensive moons, shall         again shine.   Then, dearest child, mournest thou only for Jupiter?    Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?    Something there is,   (With my lips soothing thee, adding, I whisper,   I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)    Something there is more immortal even than the stars,   (Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)    Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter,     30   Longer than sun, or any revolving satellite,   Or the radiant brothers, the Pleiades.                            I SIT and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all         oppression and shame;   I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with         themselves, remorseful after deeds done;   I see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying,         neglected, gaunt, desperate;   I see the wife misused by her husband--I see the treacherous seducer         of young women;   I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be         hid--I see these sights on the earth;   I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny--I see martyrs and         prisoners;   I observe a famine at sea--I observe the sailors casting lots who         shall be kill'd, to preserve the lives of the rest;   I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon         laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;   All these--All the meanness and agony without end, I sitting, look         out upon,   See, hear, and am silent.                                          10                                                 1As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,As I wended the shores I know,As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the         land of the globe.Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow      &nb; sp; those slender windrows,Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the         tide,Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,As I wended the shores I know,As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.2As I wend to the shores I know not,As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,A few sands and dead leaves to gather,Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I       &n; bsp;have not once had the least idea who or what I am,But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet         untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and         bows,With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single      &nb; sp; object, and that no man ever can,Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart        ; upon me and sting me,Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.3You oceans both, I close with you,We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing      &n; bsp; not why,These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.You friable shore with trails of debris,You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,What is yours is mine my father.I too Paumanok,I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been        ; wash'd on your shores,I too am but a trail of drift and debris,I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island.I throw myself upon your breast my father,I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,I hold you so firm till you answer me something.Kiss me my father,Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring         I envy.4Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you         or gather from you.I mean tenderly by you and all,I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we       & nbsp;lead, and following me and mine.Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,         drifted at random,Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets,We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out         before you,You up there walking or sitting,Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.                             FORMS, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,   The ones known, and the ones unknown--the ones on the stars,   The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,   Wonders as of those countries--the soil, trees, cities, inhabitants,         whatever they may be,   Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combinations and         effects;   Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or anywhere, stand         provided for in a handful of space, which I extend my arm and         half enclose with my hand;   That contains the start of each and all--the virtue, the germs of         all.                                                 Again a verse for sake of you,         You soldiers in the ranks- you Volunteers,         Who bravely fighting, silent fell,         To fill unmention'd graves.   ASHES of soldiers!    As I muse, retrospective, murmuring a chant in thought,   Lo! the war resumes- again to my sense your shapes,   And again the advance of armies.   Noiseless as mists and vapors,   From their graves in the trenches ascending,   From the cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,   From every point of the compass, out of the countless unnamed graves,   In wafted clouds, in myraids large, or squads of twos or threes, or         single ones, they come,   And silently gather round me.                                      10   Now sound no note, O trumpeters!    Not at the head of my cavalry, parading on spirited horses,   With sabres drawn and glist'ning, and carbines by their thighs- (ah,         my brave horsemen!    My handsome, tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,   With all the perils, were yours!)    Nor you drummers- neither at reveille, at dawn,   Nor the long roll alarming the camp- nor even the muffled beat for a         burial;    Nothing from you, this time, O drummers, bearing my warlike drums.   But aside from these, and the marts of wealth, and the crowded         promenade,   Admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and         voiceless,                                                   20   The slain elate and alive again- the dust and debris alive,   I chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead         soldiers.   Faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet;    Draw close, but speak not.   Phantoms of countless lost!    Invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions!    Follow me ever! desert me not, while I live.   Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical         voices sounding!    But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.   Dearest comrades! all is over and long gone;                       30   But love is not over- and what love, O comrades!    Perfume from battle-fields rising- up from foetor arising.   Perfume therefore my chant, O love! immortal Love!    Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,   Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride!    Perfume all! make all wholesome!    Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,   O love! O chant! solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.   Give me exhaustless- make me a fountain,   That I exhale love from me wherever I go, like a moist perennial dew,   For the ashes of all dead soldiers.                            GIVE me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams full-dazzling;   Give me juicy autumnal fruit, ripe and red from the orchard;   Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows;   Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape;   Give me fresh corn and wheat--give me serene-moving animals, teaching         content;   Give me nights perfectly quiet, as on high plateaus west of the         Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars;   Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers, where I can         walk undisturb'd;   Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman, of whom I should never         tire;   Give me a perfect child--give me, away, aside from the noise of the         world, a rural, domestic life;   Give me to warble spontaneous songs, reliev'd, recluse by myself, for         my own ears only;                                            10   Give me solitude--give me Nature--give me again, O Nature, your         primal sanities!   --These, demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement,         and rack'd by the war-strife;)   These to procure, incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,   While yet incessantly asking, still I adhere to my city;   Day upon day, and year upon year, O city, walking your streets,   Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time, refusing to give me up;   Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul--you give me forever         faces;   (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries;   I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)   Keep your splendid, silent sun;                                    20   Keep your woods, O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods;   Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and         orchards;   Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields, where the Ninth-month bees hum;   Give me faces and streets! give me these phantoms incessant and         endless along the trottoirs!   Give me interminable eyes! give me women! give me comrades and lovers         by the thousand!   Let me see new ones every day! let me hold new ones by the hand every         day!   Give me such shows! give me the streets of Manhattan!   Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of         the trumpets and drums!   (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some, starting away, flush'd         and reckless;   Some, their time up, returning, with thinn'd ranks--young, yet very         old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)                      30   --Give me the shores and the wharves heavy-fringed with the black         ships!   O such for me! O an intense life! O full to repletion, and varied!   The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!   The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the torch-         light procession!   The dense brigade, bound for the war, with high piled military wagons         following;   People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants;   Manhattan streets, with their powerful throbs, with the beating         drums, as now;   The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even         the sight of the wounded;)   Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus--with varied         chorus, and light of the sparkling eyes;   Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.                           40                                                 BATHED in war's perfume--delicate flag!   (Should the days needing armies, needing fleets, come again,)   O to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers! flag like a         beautiful woman!   O to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men! O the ships         they arm with joy!   O to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships!   O to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks!   Flag like the eyes of women.                                                 Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,Out of the Ninth-month midnight,Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child  leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded, barefoot,Down from the shower'd halo,Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as  if they were alive,Out from the patches of briers and blackberries, From the memories of the bird that chanted to me, From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as  if with tears,From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in  the mist,From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,From the myriad thence-arous'd words,From the word stronger and more delicious than any,From such as now they start the scene revisiting,As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,A reminiscence sing.Once Paumanok,When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass  was growing,Up this seashore in some briers,Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with  bright eyes,And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never  disturbing them,Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.Shine! shine! shine!Pour down your warmth, great sun! While we bask, we two together.Two together!Winds blow south, or winds blow north,Day come white, or niqht come black,Home, or rivers and mountains from home,Singing all time, minding no time,While we two keep together.Till of a sudden,May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest, Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next, Nor ever appear'd again.And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,Over the hoarse surging of the sea,Or flitting from brier to brier by day,I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,The solitary guest from Alabama.Blow! blow! blow!Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore;I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.Yes, when the stars glisten'd,All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,Down almost amid the slapping waves,Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.He call'd on his mate,He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.Yes my brother I know,	The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the  shadows,Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts,The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing, I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair, Listen'd long and long.Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes, Following you my brother.Soothe! soothe! soothe!Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,	And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,But my love soothes not me, not me.	Low hangs the moon, it rose late,It is lagging--O I think it is heavy with love, with love.O madly the sea pushes upon the land, With love, with love. O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers? What is that little black thing I see there in the white?Loud! loud! loud!Loud I call to you, my love!Hiqh and clear I shoot my voice over the waves, Surely you must know who is here, is here, You must know who I am, my love.Low-hanging moon!What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!O moon do not keep her from me any longer.Land! land! O land!Whichever way I turn, 0 I think you could give me my mate  back again if you only would,For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.O rising stars!Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.O throat! 0 trembling throat! Sound clearer through the atmosphere! Pierce the woods, the earth, Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.Shake out carols!Solitary here, the niqht's carols! Carols of lonesome love! death's carols!Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea! O reckless despairing carols.But soft! sink low! Soft! let me just murmur, And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea,For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,So faint, I must be still, be still to listen, But not altogether still, for then she miqht not come immediately to me.Hither my love! Here I am! here!With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you, This gentle call is for you my love, for you.Do not be decoy'd elsewhere,That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,Those are the shadows of leaves.O darkness! 0 in vain! 0 I am very sick and sorrowful.O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!O troubled reflection in the sea!	O throat! 0 throbbing heart!And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the niqht.	0 past! 0 happy life! 0 songs of joy!In the air, in the woods, over fields,Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!But my mate no more, no more with me!We two together no more.The aria sinking,All else continuing, the stars shining,The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping,  the face of the sea almost touching,The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying,The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last  tumultuously bursting,The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd  secret hissing,To the outsetting bard.Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I  have heard you,Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours,A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die. O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me, O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations, Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me, Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night,By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon, The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,The unknown want, the destiny of me.O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,) O if I am to have so much, let me have more!A word then, (for I will conquer it,)The word final, superior to all,Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea- waves?Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?Whereto answering, the sea, Delaying not, hurrying not, Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death, And again death, death, death, death, Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet, Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,Death, death, death, death, death.Which I do not forget, But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother, That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray beach,With the thousand responsive songs at random, My own songs awaked from that hour,And with them the key, the word up from the waves,The word of the sweetest song and all songs,That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet  garments, bending aside,)The sea whisper'd me.                            I DREAM'D in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the         whole of the rest of the earth;   I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;   Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the         rest;   It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,   And in all their looks and words.                                                 Had I the choice to tally greatest bards, To limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will, Homer with all his wars and warriors--Hector, Achilles, Ajax, Or Shakespeare's woe-entangled Hamlet, Lear, Othello--Tennyson's fair ladies, Meter or wit the best, or choice conceit to weild in perfect rhyme, delight of singers; These, these, O sea, all these I'd gladly barter, Would you the undulation of one wave, its trick to me transfer, Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse, And leave its odor there.                                                 BEHAVIOR--fresh, native, copious, each one for himself or herself,   Nature and the Soul expressed--America and freedom expressed--In it         the finest art,   In it pride, cleanliness, sympathy, to have their chance,   In it physique, intellect, faith--in it just as much as to manage an         army or a city, or to write a book--perhaps more,   The youth, the laboring person, the poor person, rivalling all the         rest--perhaps outdoing the rest,   The effects of the universe no greater than its;   For there is nothing in the whole universe that can be more effective         than a man's or woman's daily behavior can be,   In any position, in any one of These States.                            THOUGHT of the Infinite--the All!   Be thou my God.   Lover Divine, and Perfect Comrade!   Waiting, content, invisible yet, but certain,   Be thou my God.   Thou--thou, the Ideal Man!   Fair, able, beautiful, content, and loving,   Complete in Body, and dilate in Spirit,   Be thou my God.   O Death--(for Life has served its turn;)                           10   Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion!   Be thou my God.   Aught, aught, of mightiest, best, I see, conceive, or know,   (To break the stagnant tie--thee, thee to free, O Soul,)   Be thou my God.   Or thee, Old Cause, when'er advancing;   All great Ideas, the races' aspirations,   All that exalts, releases thee, my Soul!   All heroisms, deeds of rapt enthusiasts,   Be ye my Gods!                                                     20   Or Time and Space!   Or shape of Earth, divine and wondrous!   Or shape in I myself--or some fair shape, I, viewing, worship,   Or lustrous orb of Sun, or star by night:   Be ye my Gods.                              COME, my tan-faced children,   Follow well in order, get your weapons ready;   Have you your pistols? have you your sharp edged axes?           Pioneers! O pioneers!     For we cannot tarry here,   We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of danger,   We, the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     O you youths, western youths,   So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and friendship,  10   Plain I see you, western youths, see you tramping with the foremost,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Have the elder races halted?   Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied, over there beyond the         seas?   We take up the task eternal, and the burden, and the lesson,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     All the past we leave behind;   We debouch upon a newer, mightier world, varied world,   Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,           Pioneers! O pioneers!                                      20     We detachments steady throwing,   Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,   Conquering, holding, daring, venturing, as we go, the unknown ways,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     We primeval forests felling,   We the rivers stemming, vexing we, and piercing deep the mines         within;   We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Colorado men are we,   From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the high         plateaus,                                                    30   From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting trail we come,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     From Nebraska, from Arkansas,   Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the continental blood         intervein'd;   All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the         Northern,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     O resistless, restless race!   O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender love for all!   O I mourn and yet exult--I am rapt with love for all,           Pioneers! O pioneers!                                      40     Raise the mighty mother mistress,   Waving high the delicate mistress, over all the starry mistress,         (bend your heads all,)   Raise the fang'd and warlike mistress, stern, impassive, weapon'd         mistress,           Pioneers! O pioneers!   See, my children, resolute children,   By those swarms upon our rear, we must never yield or falter,   Ages back in ghostly millions, frowning there behind us urging,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     On and on, the compact ranks,   With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead quickly         fill'd,                                                      50   Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never stopping,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     O to die advancing on!   Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?   Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is fill'd,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     All the pulses of the world,   Falling in, they beat for us, with the western movement beat;   Holding single or together, steady moving, to the front, all for us,           Pioneers! O pioneers!                                      60     Life's involv'd and varied pageants,   All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their work,   All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     All the hapless silent lovers,   All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,   All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     I too with my soul and body,   We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,                 70   Through these shores, amid the shadows, with the apparitions         pressing,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Lo! the darting bowling orb!   Lo! the brother orbs around! all the clustering suns and planets,   All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     These are of us, they are with us,   All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo wait         behind,   We to-day's procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,           Pioneers! O pioneers!                                      80     O you daughters of the west!   O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!   Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Minstrels latent on the prairies!   (Shrouded bards of other lands! you may sleep--you have done your         work;)   Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Not for delectations sweet;   Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the         studious;                                                    90   Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Do the feasters gluttonous feast?   Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and bolted doors?   Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,           Pioneers! O pioneers!     Has the night descended?   Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged, nodding on         our way?   Yet a passing hour I yield you, in your tracks to pause oblivious,           Pioneers! O pioneers!                                     100     Till with sound of trumpet,   Far, far off the day-break call--hark! how loud and clear I hear it         wind;   Swift! to the head of the army!--swift! spring to your places,           Pioneers! O pioneers.                            I SING the Body electric;   The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;   They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,   And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the         Soul.   Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal         themselves;   And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the         dead?   And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?   And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?   The love of the Body of man or woman balks account--the body itself         balks account;   That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.    10   The expression of the face balks account;   But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;   It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of         his hips and wrists;   It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist         and knees--dress does not hide him;   The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton         and flannel;   To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;   You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-         side.   The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the         folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the         contour of their shape downwards,   The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the         transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls         silently to and fro in the heave of the water,   The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats--the horseman         in his saddle,                                               20   Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,   The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-         kettles, and their wives waiting,   The female soothing a child--the farmer's daughter in the garden or         cow-yard,   The young fellow hoeing corn--the sleigh-driver guiding his six         horses through the crowd,   The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,         good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown,         after work,   The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,   The upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding         the eyes;   The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine         muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,   The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes         suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,   The natural, perfect, varied attitudes--the bent head, the curv'd         neck, and the counting;                                      30   Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's         breast with the little child,   Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with         the firemen, and pause, listen, and count.   I know a man, a common farmer--the father of five sons;   And in them were the fathers of sons--and in them were the fathers of         sons.   This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;   The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and         beard, and the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes--the         richness and breadth of his manners,   These I used to go and visit him to see--he was wise also;   He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old--his sons were         massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome;   They and his daughters loved him--all who saw him loved him;   They did not love him by allowance--they loved him with personal         love;                                                        40   He drank water only--the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear-         brown skin of his face;   He was a frequent gunner and fisher--he sail'd his boat himself--he         had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner--he had         fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him;   When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,         you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of         the gang.   You would wish long and long to be with him--you would wish to sit by         him in the boat, that you and he might touch each other.   I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,   To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,   To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is         enough,   To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly         round his or her neck for a moment--what is this, then?   I do not ask any more delight--I swim in it, as in a sea.   There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on         them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the         soul well;                                                   50   All things please the soul--but these please the soul well.   This is the female form;   A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;   It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!   I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor--         all falls aside but myself and it;   Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the         atmosphere and the clouds, and what was expected of heaven or         fear'd of hell, are now consumed;   Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it--the response         likewise ungovernable;   Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all         diffused--mine too diffused;   Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb--love-flesh swelling         and deliciously aching;   Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of         love, white-blow and delirious juice;                        60   Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the         prostrate dawn;   Undulating into the willing and yielding day,   Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.   This is the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, the man is         born of woman;   This is the bath of birth--this is the merge of small and large, and         the outlet again.   Be not ashamed, women--your privilege encloses the rest, and is the         exit of the rest;   You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.   The female contains all qualities, and tempers them--she is in her         place, and moves with perfect balance;   She is all things duly veil'd--she is both passive and active;   She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as         daughters.                                                   70   As I see my soul reflected in nature;   As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and         beauty,   See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast--the female I see.   The male is not less the soul, nor more--he too is in his place;   He too is all qualities--he is action and power;   The flush of the known universe is in him;   Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;   The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is         utmost, become him well--pride is for him;   The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;   Knowledge becomes him--he likes it always--he brings everything to         the test of himself;                                         80   Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes         soundings at last only here;   (Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)   The man's body is sacred, and the woman's body is sacred;   No matter who it is, it is sacred;   Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on         the wharf?   Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off--just as         much as you;   Each has his or her place in the procession.   (All is a procession;   The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.)   Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-         face ignorant?                                               90   Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no         right to a sight?   Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float--and         the soil is on the surface, and water runs, and vegetation         sprouts,   For you only, and not for him and her?   A man's Body at auction;   I help the auctioneer--the sloven does not half know his business.   Gentlemen, look on this wonder!   Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it;   For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one         animal or plant;   For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.   In this head the all-baffling brain;                              100   In it and below it, the makings of heroes.   Examine these limbs, red, black, or white--they are so cunning in         tendon and nerve;   They shall be stript, that you may see them.   Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,   Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby,         good-sized arms and legs,   And wonders within there yet.   Within there runs blood,   The same old blood!   The same red-running blood!   There swells and jets a heart--there all passions, desires,         reachings, aspirations;                                     110   Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in         parlors and lecture-rooms?   This is not only one man--this is the father of those who shall be         fathers in their turns;   In him the start of populous states and rich republics;   Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and         enjoyments.   How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring         through the centuries?   Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace         back through the centuries?   A woman's Body at auction!   She too is not only herself--she is the teeming mother of mothers;   She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the         mothers.   Have you ever loved the Body of a woman?                          120   Have you ever loved the Body of a man?   Your father--where is your father?   Your mother--is she living? have you been much with her? and has she         been much with you?   --Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all         nations and times, all over the earth?   If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,   And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted;   And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful         as the most beautiful face.   Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool         that corrupted her own live body?   For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.   O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women,         nor the likes of the parts of you;                          130   I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the         Soul, (and that they are the Soul;)   I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems--and         that they are poems,   Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's,         father's, young man's, young woman's poems;   Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,   Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the waking or         sleeping of the lids,   Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-         hinges,   Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,   Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue,   Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample         side-round of the chest.   Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews,         arm-bones,                                                  140   Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger,         finger-balls, finger-joints, finger-nails,   Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-         side,   Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone,   Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls,         man-root,   Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,   Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg,   Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;   All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your         body, or of any one's body, male or female,   The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,   The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,                    150   Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,   Womanhood, and all that is a woman--and the man that comes from         woman,   The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping,         love-looks, love-perturbations and risings,   The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,   Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,   Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and         tightening,   The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,   The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair,   The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked         meat of the body,   The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out,     160   The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward         toward the knees,   The thin red jellies within you, or within me--the bones, and the         marrow in the bones,   The exquisite realization of health;   O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of         the Soul,   O I say now these are the Soul!                            AFOOT and light-hearted, I take to the open road,   Healthy, free, the world before me,   The long brown path before me, leading wherever I choose.   Henceforth I ask not good-fortune--I myself am good fortune;   Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,   Strong and content, I travel the open road.   The earth--that is sufficient;   I do not want the constellations any nearer;   I know they are very well where they are;   I know they suffice for those who belong to them.                  10   (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens;   I carry them, men and women--I carry them with me wherever I go;   I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them;   I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)   You road I enter upon and look around! I believe you are not all that         is here;   I believe that much unseen is also here.   Here the profound lesson of reception, neither preference or denial;   The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the         illiterate person, are not denied;   The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the         drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,   The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping         couple,                                                      20   The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the         town, the return back from the town,   They pass--I also pass--anything passes--none can be interdicted;   None but are accepted--none but are dear to me.   You air that serves me with breath to speak!   You objects that call from diffusion my meanings, and give them         shape!   You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!   You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!   I think you are latent with unseen existences--you are so dear to me.   You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!   You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides!         you distant ships!                                           30   You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd façades! you roofs!   You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!   You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!   You doors and ascending steps! you arches!   You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!   From all that has been near you, I believe you have imparted to         yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me;   From the living and the dead I think you have peopled your impassive         surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable         with me.   The earth expanding right hand and left hand,   The picture alive, every part in its best light,   The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not         wanted,                                                      40   The cheerful voice of the public road--the gay fresh sentiment of the         road.   O highway I travel! O public road! do you say to me, Do not leave me?   Do you say, Venture not? If you leave me, you are lost?   Do you say, I am already prepared--I am well-beaten and undenied--         adhere to me?   O public road! I say back, I am not afraid to leave you--yet I love         you;   You express me better than I can express myself;   You shall be more to me than my poem.   I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all         great poems also;   I think I could stop here myself, and do miracles;   (My judgments, thoughts, I henceforth try by the open air, the         road;)                                                       50   I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever         beholds me shall like me;   I think whoever I see must be happy.   From this hour, freedom!   From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines,   Going where I list, my own master, total and absolute,   Listening to others, and considering well what they say,   Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,   Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that         would hold me.   I inhale great draughts of space;   The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are         mine.                                                        60   I am larger, better than I thought;   I did not know I held so much goodness.   All seems beautiful to me;   I can repeat over to men and women, You have done such good to me, I         would do the same to you.   I will recruit for myself and you as I go;   I will scatter myself among men and women as I go;   I will toss the new gladness and roughness among them;   Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me;   Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall bless me.   Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, it would not amaze         me;                                                          70   Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd, it would not         astonish me.   Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,   It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and sleep with the earth.   Here a great personal deed has room;   A great deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,   Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law, and mocks all         authority and all argument against it.   Here is the test of wisdom;   Wisdom is not finally tested in schools;   Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it, to another not having it;   Wisdom is of the Soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own         proof,                                                       80   Applies to all stages and objects and qualities, and is content,   Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the         excellence of things;   Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes         it out of the Soul.   Now I reëxamine philosophies and religions,   They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the         spacious clouds, and along the landscape and flowing currents.   Here is realization;   Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him;   The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you         are vacant of them.   Only the kernel of every object nourishes;   Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?                90   Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?   Here is adhesiveness--it is not previously fashion'd--it is apropos;   Do you know what it is, as you pass, to be loved by strangers?   Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?   Here is the efflux of the Soul;   The efflux of the Soul comes from within, through embower'd gates,         ever provoking questions:   These yearnings, why are they? These thoughts in the darkness, why         are they?   Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me, the sun-         light expands my blood?   Why, when they leave me, do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?   Why are there trees I never walk under, but large and melodious         thoughts descend upon me?                                   100   (I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees, and always         drop fruit as I pass;)   What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?   What with some driver, as I ride on the seat by his side?   What with some fisherman, drawing his seine by the shore, as I walk         by, and pause?   What gives me to be free to a woman's or man's good-will? What gives         them to be free to mine?   The efflux of the Soul is happiness--here is happiness;   I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times;   Now it flows unto us--we are rightly charged.   Here rises the fluid and attaching character;   The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of         man and woman;                                              110   (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out         of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet         continually out of itself.)   Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love         of young and old;   From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments;   Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.   Allons! whoever you are, come travel with me!   Traveling with me, you find what never tires.   The earth never tires;   The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first--Nature is rude         and incomprehensible at first;   Be not discouraged--keep on--there are divine things, well envelop'd;   I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can         tell.                                                       120   Allons! we must not stop here!   However sweet these laid-up stores--however convenient this dwelling,         we cannot remain here;   However shelter'd this port, and however calm these waters, we must         not anchor here;   However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we are permitted         to receive it but a little while.   Allons! the inducements shall be greater;   We will sail pathless and wild seas;   We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper         speeds by under full sail.   Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements!   Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;   Allons! from all formules!                                        130   From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests!   The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.   Allons! yet take warning!   He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance;   None may come to the trial, till he or she bring courage and health.   Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself;   Only those may come, who come in sweet and determin'd bodies;   No diseas'd person--no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted         here.   I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes;   We convince by our presence.                                      140   Listen! I will be honest with you;   I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes;   These are the days that must happen to you:   You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,   You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,   You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd--you hardly         settle yourself to satisfaction, before you are call'd by an         irresistible call to depart,   You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who         remain behind you;   What beckonings of love you receive, you shall only answer with         passionate kisses of parting,   You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands         toward you.   Allons! after the GREAT COMPANIONS! and to belong to them!        150   They too are on the road! they are the swift and majestic men; they         are the greatest women.   Over that which hinder'd them--over that which retarded--passing         impediments large or small,   Committers of crimes, committers of many beautiful virtues,   Enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of seas,   Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,   Habitués of many distant countries, habitués of far-distant dwellings,   Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,   Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,   Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of         children, bearers of children,   Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers down of         coffins,                                                    160   Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years--the curious         years, each emerging from that which preceded it,   Journeyers as with companions, namely, their own diverse phases,   Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,   Journeyers gayly with their own youth--Journeyers with their bearded         and well-grain'd manhood,   Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,   Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,   Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the         universe,   Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.   Allons! to that which is endless, as it was beginningless,   To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,                 170   To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they         tend to,   Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys;   To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,   To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and         pass it,   To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you--         however long, but it stretches and waits for you;   To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,   To see no possession but you may possess it--enjoying all without         labor or purchase--abstracting the feast, yet not abstracting         one particle of it;   To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant         villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and         the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,   To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,   To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you         go,                                                         180   To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter         them--to gather the love out of their hearts,   To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them         behind you,   To know the universe itself as a road--as many roads--as roads for         traveling souls.   The Soul travels;   The body does not travel as much as the soul;   The body has just as great a work as the soul, and parts away at last         for the journeys of the soul.   All parts away for the progress of souls;   All religion, all solid things, arts, governments,--all that was or         is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and         corners before the procession of Souls along the grand roads of         the universe.   Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads         of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and         sustenance.   Forever alive, forever forward,                                   190   Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,         dissatisfied,   Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,   They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go;   But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great.   Allons! whoever you are! come forth!   You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though         you built it, or though it has been built for you.   Allons! out of the dark confinement!   It is useless to protest--I know all, and expose it.   Behold, through you as bad as the rest,   Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,        200   Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd         faces,   Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.   No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession;   Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,   Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and         bland in the parlors,   In the cars of rail-roads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,   Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bed-room,         everywhere,   Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the         breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,   Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial         flowers,   Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, 210   Speaking of anything else, but never of itself.   Allons! through struggles and wars!   The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.   Have the past struggles succeeded?   What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature?   Now understand me well--It is provided in the essence of things, that         from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth         something to make a greater struggle necessary.   My call is the call of battle--I nourish active rebellion;   He going with me must go well arm'd;   He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies,         desertions.   Allons! the road is before us!                                    220   It is safe--I have tried it--my own feet have tried it well.   Allons! be not detain'd!   Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen'd!   Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd!   Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!   Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law.   Mon enfant! I give you my hand!   I give you my love, more precious than money,   I give you myself, before preaching or law;   Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?          230   Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?                            OVER the western sea, hither from Niphon come,   Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,   Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,   Ride to-day through Manhattan.   Libertad!   I do not know whether others behold what I behold,   In the procession, along with the nobles of Asia, the errand-         bearers,   Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks         marching;   But I will sing you a song of what I behold, Libertad.   When million-footed Manhattan, unpent, descends to her pavements;  10   When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar I love;   When the round-mouth'd guns, out of the smoke and smell I love, spit         their salutes;   When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me--when heaven-clouds         canopy my city with a delicate thin haze;   When, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the forests at the         wharves, thicken with colors;   When every ship, richly drest, carries her flag at the peak;   When pennants trail, and street-festoons hang from the windows;   When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and foot-         standers--when the mass is densest;   When the façades of the houses are alive with people--when eyes gaze,         riveted, tens of thousands at a time;   When the guests from the islands advance--when the pageant moves         forward, visible;   When the summons is made--when the answer that waited thousands of         years, answers;                                              20   I too, arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the         crowd, and gaze with them.   Superb-faced Manhattan!   Comrade Americanos!--to us, then, at last, the Orient comes.   To us, my city,   Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite         sides--to walk in the space between,   To-day our Antipodes comes.   The Originatress comes,   The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,   Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,   Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments, 30   With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,   The race of Brahma comes!   See, my cantabile! these, and more, are flashing to us from the         procession;   As it moves, changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves, changing,         before us.   For not the envoys, nor the tann'd Japanee from his island only;   Lithe and silent, the Hindoo appears--the Asiatic continent itself         appears--the Past, the dead,   The murky night morning of wonder and fable, inscrutable,   The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,   The North--the sweltering South--eastern Assyria--the Hebrews--the         Ancient of Ancients,   Vast desolated cities--the gliding Present--all of these, and more,         are in the pageant-procession.                               40   Geography, the world, is in it;   The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond;   The coast you, henceforth, are facing--you Libertad! from your         Western golden shores   The countries there, with their populations--the millions en-masse,         are curiously here;   The swarming market places--the temples, with idols ranged along the         sides, or at the end--bonze, brahmin, and lama;   The mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman;   The singing-girl and the dancing-girl--the ecstatic person--the         secluded Emperors,   Confucius himself--the great poets and heroes--the warriors, the         castes, all,   Trooping up, crowding from all directions--from the Altay mountains,   From Thibet--from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of         China,                                                       50   From the Southern peninsulas, and the demi-continental islands--from         Malaysia;   These, and whatever belongs to them, palpable, show forth to me, and         are seiz'd by me,   And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,   Till, as here, them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for         you.   For I too, raising my voice, join the ranks of this pageant;   I am the chanter--I chant aloud over the pageant;   I chant the world on my Western Sea;   I chant, copious, the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky;   I chant the new empire, grander than any before--As in a vision it         comes to me;   I chant America, the Mistress--I chant a greater supremacy;        60   I chant, projected, a thousand blooming cities yet, in time, on those         groups of sea-islands;   I chant my sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes;   I chant my stars and stripes fluttering in the wind;   I chant commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work--         races, reborn, refresh'd;   Lives, works, resumed--The object I know not--but the old, the         Asiatic, renew'd, as it must be,   Commencing from this day, surrounded by the world.   And you, Libertad of the world!   You shall sit in the middle, well-pois'd, thousands of years;   As to-day, from one side, the nobles of Asia come to you;   As to-morrow, from the other side, the Queen of England sends her         eldest son to you.                                           70   The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,   The ring is circled, the journey is done;   The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd--nevertheless the perfume pours         copiously out of the whole box.   Young Libertad!   With the venerable Asia, the all-mother,   Be considerate with her, now and ever, hot Libertad--for you are all;   Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother, now sending messages         over the archipelagoes to you;   Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.   Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?   Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so         long?                                                        80   Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while         unknown, for you, for reasons?   They are justified--they are accomplish'd--they shall now be turn'd         the other way also, to travel toward you thence;   They shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake,         Libertad.                                                 AS at thy portals also death,   Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds,   To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, maternity,   To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,   (I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still,   I sit by the form in the coffin,   I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks,         the closed eyes in the coffin;)   To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of earth, life,         love, to me the best,   I grave a monumental line, before I go, amid these songs,   And set a tombstone here.                                          10                            O LIVING always--always dying!   O the burials of me, past and present!   O me, while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever!   O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not--I am content;)   O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and look         at, where I cast them!   To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind!                            A LINE in long array, where they wind betwixt green islands;   They take a serpentine course--their arms flash in the sun--Hark to         the musical clank;   Behold the silvery river--in it the splashing horses, loitering, stop         to drink;   Behold the brown-faced men--each group, each person, a picture--the         negligent rest on the saddles;   Some emerge on the opposite bank--others are just entering the ford--         while,   Scarlet, and blue, and snowy white,   The guidon flags flutter gaily in the wind.                            CITY of ships!   (O the black ships! O the fierce ships!   O the beautiful, sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)   City of the world! (for all races are here;   All the lands of the earth make contributions here;)   City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!   City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and         out, with eddies and foam!   City of wharves and stores! city of tall façades of marble and iron!   Proud and passionate city! mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!   Spring up, O city! not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself,         warlike!                                                     10   Fear not! submit to no models but your own, O city!   Behold me! incarnate me, as I have incarnated you!   I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted, I have         adopted;   Good or bad, I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn         anything;   I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more;   In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine;   War, red war, is my song through your streets, O city!                            O YOU whom I often and silently come where you are, that I may be         with you;   As I walk by your side, or sit near, or remain in the same room with         you,   Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is         playing within me.                            O HYMEN! O hymenee!   Why do you tantalize me thus?   O why sting me for a swift moment only?   Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?   Is it because, if you continued beyond the swift moment, you would         soon certainly kill me?                                                 TWO boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still,   Ten fishermen waiting--they discover a thick school of mossbonkers--         they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,   The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course to the         beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,   The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,   Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand ankle-deep         in the water, pois'd on strong legs,   The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,   Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the water,         the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.                            WHY! who makes much of a miracle?   As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles,   Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,   Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,   Or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the         water,   Or stand under trees in the woods,   Or talk by day with any one I love--or sleep in the bed at night with         any one I love,   Or sit at table at dinner with my mother,   Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,   Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,    10   Or animals feeding in the fields,   Or birds--or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,   Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down--or of stars shining so quiet         and bright,   Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;   Or whether I go among those I like best, and that like me best--         mechanics, boatmen, farmers,   Or among the savans--or to the soiree--or to the opera,   Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,   Or behold children at their sports,   Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old         woman,   Or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,           20   Or my own eyes and figure in the glass;   These, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,   The whole referring--yet each distinct, and in its place.   To me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,   Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,   Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the         same,   Every foot of the interior swarms with the same;   Every spear of grass--the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women,         and all that concerns them,   All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.   To me the sea is a continual miracle;                              30   The fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the ships,         with men in them,   What stranger miracles are there?                                                 from Memories of President Lincoln1When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd, And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night, I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, And thought of him I love.2O powerful western fallen star! O shades of night -- O moody, tearful night! O great star disappear'd -- O the black murk that hides the star! O cruel hands that hold me powerless -- O helpless soul of me! O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.3In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings, Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love, With every leaf a miracle -- and from this bush in the dooryard, With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, A sprig with its flower I break.4In the swamp in secluded recesses, A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. Solitary the thrush, The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, Sings by himself a song.Song of the bleeding throat, Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know, If thou wast not granted to sing, thou would'st surely die.)5Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd from the ground, spotting the gray debris, Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, Night and day journeys a coffin.6Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black, With the show of the States themselves as of crepe-veil'd women standing, With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey, With the tolling bells' perpetual clang, Here, coffin that slowly passes, I give you a sprig of lilac.7(Nor for you, for one alone, Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring, For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death.All over bouquets of roses, O death, I cover you with roses and early lilies, But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes, With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, For you and the coffins all of you, O death.)8O western orb sailing the heaven, Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd, As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look'd on,) As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,) As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe, As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night, As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of the night, As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.9Sing on there in the swamp, O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call, I hear, I come presently, I understand you, But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me, The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.10O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? And how shall I deck my soul for the large sweet soul that has gone? And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?Sea-winds blown from the east and west, Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies meeting, These and with these and the breath of my chant, I'll perfume the grave of him I love.11O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial-house of him I love?Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes, With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air, With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific, In the distance of the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows, And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.12Lo, body and soul -- this land, My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio's shores and flashing Missouri, And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, The gentle soft-born measureless light, The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon, The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.13Sing on, sing on, you gray-brown bird, Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes, Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song, Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.O liquid and free and tender! O wild and loose to my soul -- O wondrous singer! You only I hear -- yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,) Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.14Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth, In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops, In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests, In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and storms,) Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent -- lo, then and there, Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail, And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not, Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars and the ghostly pines so still.And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me, The gray-brown bird I know received us comrades three, And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.>From deep secluded recesses, >From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird.And the charm of the carol rapt me, As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night, And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.Come lovely and soothing death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later delicate death.Prais'd be the fathomless universe, For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, And for love, sweet love -- but praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet, Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all, I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.Approach strong deliveress, When it is so, when you have taken them I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O death.From me to thee glad serenades, Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee, And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.The night in silence under many a star, The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know, And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death, And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.Over the treetops I float thee a song, Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide, Over the dense-packed cities and all the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.15To the tally of my soul, Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.Loud in the pines and cedars dim, Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume, And I with my comrades there in the night.While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions.And I saw askant the armies, I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierced with missiles I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloody, And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (all in silence,) And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them, I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war, But I saw they were not as was thought, They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not, The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd, And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd, And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.16Passing the visions, passing the night, Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands, Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.I cease from my song for thee, From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep for the dead I loved so well, For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake, Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.                            ABOARD, at a ship's helm,   A young steersman, steering with care.   A bell through fog on a sea-coast dolefully ringing,   An ocean-bell--O a warning bell, rock'd by the waves.   O you give good notice indeed, you bell by the sea-reefs ringing,   Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreck-place.   For, as on the alert, O steersman, you mind the bell's admonition,   The bows turn,--the freighted ship, tacking, speeds away under her         gray sails,   The beautiful and noble ship, with all her precious wealth, speeds         away gaily and safe.   But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard the ship!         10   O ship of the body--ship of the soul--voyaging, voyaging, voyaging.                                                 ADIEU, O soldier!    You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)    The rapid march, the life of the camp,   The hot contention of opposing fronts- the long manoeuver,   Red battles with their slaughter,- the stimulus- the strong, terrific         game,   Spell of all brave and manly hearts- the trains of Time through you,         and like of you, all fill'd,   With war, and war's expression.   Adieu, dear comrade!    Your mission is fulfill'd- but I, more warlike,   Myself, and this contentious soul of mine,                         10   Still on our own campaigning bound,   Through untried roads, with ambushes, opponents lined,   Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis- often baffled,   Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out- aye here,   To fiercer, weightier battles give expression.                                                 AFTER the Sea-Ship--after the whistling winds;   After the white-gray sails, taut to their spars and ropes,   Below, a myriad, myriad waves, hastening, lifting up their necks,   Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship:   Waves of the ocean, bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,   Waves, undulating waves--liquid, uneven, emulous waves,   Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,   Where the great Vessel, sailing and tacking, displaced the surface;   Larger and smaller waves, in the spread of the ocean, yearnfully         flowing;   The wake of the Sea-Ship, after she passes--flashing and frolicsome,         under the sun,                                               10   A motley procession, with many a fleck of foam, and many fragments,   Following the stately and rapid Ship--in the wake following.                            IN midnight sleep, of many a face of anguish,   Of the look at first of the mortally wounded--of that indescribable         look;   Of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide,       I dream, I dream, I dream.   Of scenes of nature, fields and mountains;   Of skies, so beauteous after a storm--and at night the moon so         unearthly bright,   Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather         the heaps,       I dream, I dream, I dream.   Long, long have they pass'd--faces and trenches and fields;   Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure--or away         from the fallen,   Onward I sped at the time--But now of their forms at night,       I dream, I dream, I dream.                                     10                                                 When I heard the learn'd astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide,  and measure them,When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.                            A LEAF for hand in hand!   You natural persons old and young!   You on the Mississippi, and on all the branches and bayous of the         Mississippi!   You friendly boatmen and mechanics! You roughs!   You twain! And all processions moving along the streets!   I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to         walk hand in hand!                            TO get betimes in Boston town, I rose this morning early;   Here's a good place at the corner--I must stand and see the show.   Clear the way there, Jonathan!   Way for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!   Way for the Federal foot and dragoons--and the apparitions copiously         tumbling.   I love to look on the stars and stripes--I hope the fifes will play         Yankee Doodle.   How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!   Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.   A fog follows--antiques of the same come limping,   Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. 10   Why this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out of the earth!   The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!   Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!   Cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!   Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders!   What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of         bare gums?   Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for         fire-locks, and level them?   If you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's         marshal;   If you groan such groans, you might balk the government cannon.   For shame, old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd arms, and let your         white hair be;                                               20   Here gape your great grand-sons--their wives gaze at them from the         windows,   See how well dress'd--see how orderly they conduct themselves.   Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?   Is this hour with the living too dead for you?   Retreat then! Pell-mell!   To your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!   I do not think you belong here, anyhow.   But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it         is, gentlemen of Boston?   I will whisper it to the Mayor--he shall send a committee to England;   They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the         royal vault--haste!                                          30   Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-         clothes, box up his bones for a journey;   Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied         clipper,   Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward         Boston bay.   Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government         cannon,   Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard         it with foot and dragoons.   This centre-piece for them:   Look! all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!   The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that         will not stay,   Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the         skull.   You have got your revenge, old buster! The crown is come to its own,         and more than its own.   Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from         this day;                                                    40   You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.                            BEAT! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!   Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless force,   Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation;   Into the school where the scholar is studying;   Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with         his bride;   Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, plowing his field or gathering his         grain;   So fierce you whirr and pound, you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.   Beat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!   Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets:   Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? No sleepers         must sleep in those beds;                                    10   No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--Would they         continue?   Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?   Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the         judge?   Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.   Beat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!   Make no parley--stop for no expostulation;   Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer;   Mind not the old man beseeching the young man;   Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties;   Make even the trestles to shake the dead, where they lie awaiting the         hearses,                                                     20   So strong you thump, O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.                            ARE you the new person drawn toward me?   To begin with, take warning--I am surely far different from what you         suppose;   Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?   Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?   Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd satisfaction?   Do you think I am trusty and faithful?   Do you see no further than this façade--this smooth and tolerant         manner of me?   Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic         man?   Have you no thought, O dreamer, that it may be all maya, illusion?                            A SONG of the good green grass!   A song no more of the city streets;   A song of farms--a song of the soil of fields.   A song with the smell of sun-dried hay, where the nimble pitchers         handle the pitch-fork;   A song tasting of new wheat, and of fresh-husk'd maize.   For the lands, and for these passionate days, and for myself,   Now I awhile return to thee, O soil of Autumn fields,   Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,   Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,   Tuning a verse for thee.                                           10   O Earth, that hast no voice, confide to me a voice!   O harvest of my lands! O boundless summer growths!   O lavish, brown, parturient earth! O infinite, teeming womb!   A verse to seek, to see, to narrate thee.   Ever upon this stage,   Is acted God's calm, annual drama,   Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,   Sunrise, that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,   The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,   The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,        20   The flowers, the grass, the lilliput, countless armies of the grass,   The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,   The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,   The stretching, light-hung roof of clouds--the clear cerulean, and         the bulging, silvery fringes,   The high dilating stars, the placid, beckoning stars,   The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,   The shows of all the varied lands, and all the growths and products.   Fecund America! To-day,   Thou art all over set in births and joys!   Thou groan'st with riches! thy wealth clothes thee as with a swathing         garment!                                                     30   Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions!   A myriad-twining life, like interlacing vines, binds all thy vast         demesne!   As some huge ship, freighted to water's edge, thou ridest into port!   As rain falls from the heaven, and vapors rise from earth, so have         the precious values fallen upon thee, and risen out of thee!   Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!   Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty!   Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns!   Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle, and lookest out upon         thy world, and lookest East, and lookest West!   Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles--that giv'st a         million farms, and missest nothing!   Thou All-Acceptress--thou Hospitable--(thou only art hospitable, as         God is hospitable.)                                          40   When late I sang, sad was my voice;   Sad were the shows around me, with deafening noises of hatred, and         smoke of conflict;   In the midst of the armies, the Heroes, I stood,   Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.   But now I sing not War,   Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,   Nor the regiments hastily coming up, deploying in line of battle.   No more the dead and wounded;   No more the sad, unnatural shows of War.   Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks? the first forth-stepping         armies?                                                      50   Ask room, alas, the ghastly ranks--the armies dread that follow'd.   (Pass--pass, ye proud brigades!   So handsome, dress'd in blue--with your tramping, sinewy legs;   With your shoulders young and strong--with your knapsacks and your         muskets;   --How elate I stood and watch'd you, where, starting off, you         march'd!   Pass;--then rattle, drums, again!   Scream, you steamers on the river, out of whistles loud and shrill,         your salutes!   For an army heaves in sight--O another gathering army!   Swarming, trailing on the rear--O you dread, accruing army!   O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea! with your         fever!                                                       60   O my land's maimed darlings! with the plenteous bloody bandage and         the crutch!   Lo! your pallid army follow'd!)   But on these days of brightness,   On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the         high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,   Shall the dead intrude?   Ah, the dead to me mar not--they fit well in Nature;   They fit very well in the landscape, under the trees and grass,   And along the edge of the sky, in the horizon's far margin.   Nor do I forget you, departed;   Nor in winter or summer, my lost ones;                             70   But most, in the open air, as now, when my soul is rapt and at         peace--like pleasing phantoms,   Your dear memories, rising, glide silently by me.   I saw the day, the return of the Heroes;   (Yet the Heroes never surpass'd, shall never return;   Them, that day, I saw not.)   I saw the interminable Corps--I saw the processions of armies,   I saw them approaching, defiling by, with divisions,   Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of         mighty camps.   No holiday soldiers!--youthful, yet veterans;   Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and         workshop,   Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,                 80   Inured on many a hard-fought, bloody field.   A pause--the armies wait;   A million flush'd, embattled conquerors wait;   The world, too, waits--then, soft as breaking night, and sure as         dawn,   They melt--they disappear.   Exult, indeed, O lands! victorious lands!   Not there your victory, on those red, shuddering fields;   But here and hence your victory.   Melt, melt away, ye armies! disperse, ye blue-clad soldiers!   Resolve ye back again--give up, for good, your deadly arms;        90   Other the arms, the fields henceforth for you, or South or North, or         East or West,   With saner wars--sweet wars--life-giving wars.   Loud, O my throat, and clear, O soul!   The season of thanks, and the voice of full-yielding;   The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.   All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me;   I see the true arenas of my race--or first, or last,   Man's innocent and strong arenas.   I see the Heroes at other toils;   I see, well-wielded in their hands, the better weapons.           100   I see where America, Mother of All,   Well-pleased, with full-spanning eye, gazes forth, dwells long,   And counts the varied gathering of the products.   Busy the far, the sunlit panorama;   Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,   Cotton and rice of the South, and Louisianian cane;   Open, unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,   Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,   And many a stately river flowing, and many a jocund brook,   And healthy uplands with their herby-perfumed breezes,            110   And the good green grass--that delicate miracle, the ever-recurring         grass.   Toil on, Heroes! harvest the products!   Not alone on those warlike fields, the Mother of All,   With dilated form and lambent eyes, watch'd you.   Toil on, Heroes! toil well! Handle the weapons well!   The Mother of All--yet here, as ever, she watches you.   Well-pleased, America, thou beholdest,   Over the fields of the West, those crawling monsters,   The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements:   Beholdest, moving in every direction, imbued as with life, the         revolving hay-rakes,                                        120   The steam-power reaping-machines, and the horse-power machines,   The engines, thrashers of grain, and cleaners of grain, well         separating the straw--the nimble work of the patent pitch-fork;   Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the rice-         cleanser.   Beneath thy look, O Maternal,   With these, and else, and with their own strong hands, the Heroes         harvest.   All gather, and all harvest;   (Yet but for thee, O Powerful! not a scythe might swing, as now, in         security;   Not a maize-stalk dangle, as now, its silken tassels in peace.)   Under Thee only they harvest--even but a wisp of hay, under thy great         face, only;   Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin--every barbed spear,         under thee;                                                 130   Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee--each ear in its         light-green sheath,   Gather the hay to its myriad mows, in the odorous, tranquil barns,   Oats to their bins--the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to         theirs;   Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama--dig and hoard the         golden, the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,   Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,   Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp, or tobacco in the         Borders,   Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees, or bunches         of grapes from the vines,   Or aught that ripens in all These States, or North or South,   Under the beaming sun, and under Thee.                            A MARCH in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown;   A route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the darkness;   Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating;   Till after midnight glimmer upon us, the lights of a dim-lighted         building;   We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted         building;   'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads--'tis now an impromptu         hospital;   --Entering but for a minute, I see a sight beyond all the pictures         and poems ever made:   Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and         lamps,   And by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame, and         clouds of smoke;   By these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely I see, on the floor, some         in the pews laid down;                                       10   At my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of         bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen;)   I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a         lily;)   Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene, fain to absorb         it all;   Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,         some of them dead;   Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,         the odor of blood;   The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiers--the yard         outside also fill'd;   Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the         death-spasm sweating;   An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls;   The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the         torches;   These I resume as I chant--I see again the forms, I smell the         odor;                                                        20   Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, Fall in;   But first I bend to the dying lad--his eyes open--a half-smile gives         he me;   Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,   Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,   The unknown road still marching.                            A PROMISE to California,   Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:   Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,         to teach robust American love;   For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you, inland,         and along the Western Sea;   For These States tend inland, and toward the Western Sea--and I will         also.                                                 WOMEN sit, or move to and fro- some old, some young;    The young are beautiful- but the old are more beautiful than the         young.                                                 THAT which eludes this verse and any verse,   Unheard by sharpest ear, unform'd in clearest eye or cunningest mind,   Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,   And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world         incessantly,   Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,   Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion,   Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner,   Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose,   Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted,   Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter'd,      10   Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.   Indifferently, 'mid public, private haunts, in solitude,   Behind the mountain and the wood,   Companion of the city's busiest streets, through the assemblage,   It and its radiations constantly glide.   In looks of fair unconscious babes,   Or strangely in the coffin'd dead,   Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,   As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,   Hiding yet lingering.                                              20   Two little breaths of words comprising it.   Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it.   How ardently for it!   How many ships have sail'd and sunk for it!   How many travelers started from their homes and ne'er return'd!   How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!   What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur'd for it!   How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it--and         shall be to the end!   How all heroic martyrdoms to it!   How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth!    30   How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and         land, have drawn men's eyes,   Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the         cliffs,   Or midnight's silent glowing northern lights unreachable.   Haply God's riddle it, so vague and yet so certain,   The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it,   And heaven at last for it.                            A SIGHT in camp in the day-break grey and dim,   As from my tent I emerge so early, sleepless,   As slow I walk in the cool fresh air, the path near by the hospital         tent,   Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended         lying,   Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,   Grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.   Curious, I halt, and silent stand;   Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest, the first,         just lift the blanket:   Who are you, elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-grey'd hair,         and flesh all sunken about the eyes?   Who are you, my dear comrade?                                      10   Then to the second I step--And who are you, my child and darling?   Who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?   Then to the third--a face nor child, nor old, very calm, as of         beautiful yellow-white ivory;   Young man, I think I know you--I think this face of yours is the face         of the Christ himself;   Dead and divine, and brother of all, and here again he lies.                                                 PASSING stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,   You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me,         as of a dream,)    I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,   All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate,         chaste, matured,   You grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl with me,   I ate with you, and slept with you- your body has become not yours         only, nor left my body mine only,   You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass- you         take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,   I am not to speak to you- I am to think of you when I sit alone, or         wake at night alone,   I am to wait- I do not doubt I am to meet you again,   I am to see to it that I do not lose you.                          10                                                 I Celebrate myself, and sing myself,And what I assume you shall assume,For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.I loafe and invite my soul,I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil,	this air,Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and 	their parents the same,I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,Hoping to cease not till death.Creeds and schools in abeyance,Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never	forgotten,I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,Nature without check with original energy.                            O ME! O life!... of the questions of these recurring;   Of the endless trains of the faithless--of cities fill'd with the         foolish;   Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I,         and who more faithless?)   Of eyes that vainly crave the light--of the objects mean--of the         struggle ever renew'd;   Of the poor results of all--of the plodding and sordid crowds I see         around me;   Of the empty and useless years of the rest--with the rest me         intertwined;   The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O         life?                                Answer.   That you are here--that life exists, and identity;   That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.                                                 ARM’D year! year of the struggle! No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year! Not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas       piano; But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,       carrying a rifle on your shoulder, With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands–with a knife in       the belt at your side, As I heard you shouting loud–your sonorous voice ringing across the       continent; Your masculine voice, O year, as rising amid the great cities, Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the       dwellers in Manhattan; Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and       Indiana, Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait, and descending the       Alleghanies; Or down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along       the Ohio river; Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at       Chattanooga on the mountain top, Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing       weapons, robust year; Heard your determin’d voice, launch’d forth again and again; Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannon, I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.                            O ME, man of slack faith so long!   Standing aloof--denying portions so long;   Only aware to-day of compact, all-diffused truth;   Discovering to-day there is no lie, or form of lie, and can be none,         but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon         itself,   Or as any law of the earth, or any natural production of the earth         does.   (This is curious, and may not be realized immediately--But it must be         realized;   I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest,   And that the universe does.)   Where has fail'd a perfect return, indifferent of lies or the truth?   Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man?         or in the meat and blood?                                    10   Meditating among liars, and retreating sternly into myself, I see         that there are really no liars or lies after all,   And that nothing fails its perfect return--And that what are called         lies are perfect returns,   And that each thing exactly represents itself, and what has preceded         it,   And that the truth includes all, and is compact, just as much as         space is compact,   And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth--but         that all is truth without exception;   And henceforth I will go celebrate anything I see or am,   And sing and laugh, and deny nothing.                                                    I Hear America singing, the varied carols I hear;   Those of mechanics--each one singing his, as it should be, blithe and strong;   The carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank or beam,   The mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work;   The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat--the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck;   The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench--the hatter singing as he stands;   The wood-cutter's song--the ploughboy's, on his way in the morning, or at the noon intermission, or at sundown;   The delicious singing of the mother--or of the young wife at work--or of the girl sewing or washing--Each singing what belongs to her, and to none else;   The day what belongs to the day--At night, the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,   Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious songs.                            HOLD it up sternly! See this it sends back! (Who is it? Is it you?)   Outside fair costume--within ashes and filth,   No more a flashing eye--no more a sonorous voice or springy step;   Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,   A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,   Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,   Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,   Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,   Words babble, hearing and touch callous,   No brain, no heart left--no magnetism of sex;                      10   Such, from one look in this looking-glass ere you go hence,   Such a result so soon--and from such a beginning!                            THROUGH the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,   A sun-lit pasture field, with cattle and horses feeding;   And haze, and vista, and the far horizon, fading away.                            A WOMAN waits for me--she contains all, nothing is lacking,   Yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the         right man were lacking.   Sex contains all,   Bodies, Souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results,         promulgations,   Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal         milk;   All hopes, benefactions, bestowals,   All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,   All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,   These are contain'd in sex, as parts of itself, and justifications of         itself.   Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his         sex,                                                         10   Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.   Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,   I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that         are warm-blooded and sufficient for me;   I see that they understand me, and do not deny me;   I see that they are worthy of me--I will be the robust husband of         those women.   They are not one jot less than I am,   They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,   Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,   They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike,         retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,   They are ultimate in their own right--they are calm, clear, well-         possess'd of themselves.                                     20   I draw you close to me, you women!   I cannot let you go, I would do you good,   I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for         others' sakes;   Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,   They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.   It is I, you women--I make my way,   I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable--but I love you,   I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,   I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for These States--I         press with slow rude muscle,   I brace myself effectually--I listen to no entreaties,             30   I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated         within me.   Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,   In you I wrap a thousand onward years,   On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,   The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new         artists, musicians, and singers,   The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,   I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,   I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you         interpenetrate now,   I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I         count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,   I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death,         immortality, I plant so lovingly now.                        40                            COME, I will make the continent indissoluble;   I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon;   I will make divine magnetic lands,             With the love of comrades,             With the life-long love of comrades.   I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of         America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over         the prairies;   I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each other's         necks;           By the love of comrades,             By the manly love of comrades.   For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you, ma femme!       10   For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,           In the love of comrades,             In the high-towering love of comrades.                            SILENT and amazed, even when a little boy,   I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his         statements,   As contending against some being or influence.                            A GLIMPSE, through an interstice caught,   Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room, around the stove,         late of a winter night--And I unremark'd seated in a corner;   Of a youth who loves me, and whom I love, silently approaching, and         seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand;   A long while, amid the noises of coming and going--of drinking and         oath and smutty jest,   There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,         perhaps not a word.                                                 A noiseless, patient spider,	 I mark’d, where, on a little promontory, it stood, isolated;	 Mark’d how, to explore the vacant, vast surrounding,	 It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself;	 Ever unreeling them—ever tirelessly speeding them.	          And you, O my Soul, where you stand,	 Surrounded, surrounded, in measureless oceans of space,	 Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,—seeking the spheres, to connect them;	 Till the bridge you will need, be form’d—till the ductile anchor hold;	 Till the gossamer thread you fling, catch somewhere, O my Soul.                                                 A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full	hands;How could I answer the child?. . . .I do not know what it	is any more than he.I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful	green stuff woven.Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we	may see and remark, and say Whose?Or I guess the grass is itself a child. . . .the produced babe	of the vegetation.Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow	zones,Growing among black folks as among white,Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly will I use you curling grass,It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;It may be you are from old people and from women, and	from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,And here you are the mother's laps.This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old	mothers,Darker than the colorless beards of old men,Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths	for nothing.I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men	and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring	taken soon out of their laps.What do you think has become of the young and old men?What do you think has become of the women and	children?They are alive and well somewhere;The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait	at the end to arrest it,And ceased the moment life appeared.All goes onward and outward. . . .and nothing collapses,And to die is different from what any one supposed, and	luckier.                                                 THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,   Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,   Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou         lovest best.   Night, sleep, death and the stars.                            O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;   The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;   The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,   While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:       But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.   O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;   Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;      10   For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;       Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head;           It is some dream that on the deck,             You've fallen cold and dead.

Ask the red dustOf empires passed away;The blood has turned their stones to rust,Their glory to decay.And is it pride? Ah, that bright crownHas seemed to nations sweet;But God has struck its luster downIn ashes at his feet.Not gold but only men can makeA people great and strong;Men who for truth and honor's sakeStand fast and suffer long.Brave men who work while others sleep,Who dare while others fly...They build a nation's pillars deepAnd lift them to the sky.                                                 S.

At Martin's BeachWe chose our boats; each man a boat and guide,--Ten men, ten guides, our company all told.Next morn, we swept with oars the Saranac,With skies of benediction, to Round Lake,Where all the sacred mountains drew around us,Tahawus, Seaward, MacIntyre, Baldhead,And other Titans without muse or name.Pleased with these grand companions, we glide on,Instead of flowers, crowned with a wreath of hills,And made our distance wider, boat from boat,As each would hear the oracle alone.By the bright morn the gay flotilla slidThrough files of flags that gleamed like bayonets,Through gold-moth-haunted beds of pickerel-flower,Through scented banks of lilies white and gold,Where the deer feeds at night, the teal by day,On through the Upper Saranac, and upPere Raquette stream, to a small tortuous passWinding through grassy shallows in and out,Two creeping miles of rushes, pads, and sponge,To Follansbee Water, and the Lake of Loons.Northward the length of Follansbee we rowed,Under low mountains, whose unbroken ridgePonderous with beechen forest sloped the shore.A pause and council: then, where near the headOn the east a bay makes inward to the landBetween two rocky arms, we climb the bank,And in the twilight of the forest noonWield the first axe these echoes ever heard.We cut young trees to make our poles and thwarts,Barked the white spruce to weatherfend the roof,Then struck a light, and kindled the camp-fire.The wood was sovran with centennial trees,--Oak, cedar, maple, poplar, beech and fir,Linden and spruce. In strict societyThree conifers, white, pitch, and Norway pine,Five-leaved, three-leaved, and two-leaved, grew thereby.Our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth,The maple eight, beneath its shapely tower.'Welcome!' the wood god murmured through the leaves,--'Welcome, though late, unknowing, yet known to me.'Evening drew on; stars peeped through maple-boughs,Which o'erhung, like a cloud, our camping fire.Decayed millennial trunks, like moonlight flecks,Lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor.Ten scholars, wonted to lie warm and softIn well-hung chambers daintily bestowed,Lie here on hemlock-boughs, like Sacs and Sioux,And greet unanimous the joyful change.So fast will Nature acclimate her sons,Though late returning to her pristine ways.Off soundings, seamen do not suffer cold;And, in the forest, delicate clerks, unbrowned,Sleep on the fragrant brush, as on down-beds.Up with the dawn, they fancied the light airThat circled freshly in their forest dressMade them to boys again. Happier that theySlipped off their pack of duties, leagues behind,At the first mounting of the giant stairs.No placard on these rocks warned to the polls,No door-bell heralded a visitor,No courier waits, no letter came or went,Nothing was ploughed, or reaped, or bought, or sold;The frost might glitter, it would blight no crop,The falling rain will spoil no holiday.We were made freemen of the forest laws,All dressed, like Nature, fit for her own ends,Essaying nothing she cannot perform.In Adirondac lakes,At morn or noon, the guide rows bareheaded:Shoes, flannel shirt, and kersey trousers makeHis brief toilette: at night, or in the rain,He dons a surcoat which he doffs at morn:A paddle in the right hand, or an oar,And in the left, a gun, his needful arms.By turns we praised the stature of our guides,Their rival strength and suppleness, their skillTo row, to swim, to shoot, to build a camp,To climb a lofty stem, clean without boughsFull fifty feet, and bring the eaglet down:Temper to face wolf, bear, or catamount,And wit to track or take him in his lair.Sound, ruddy men, frolic and innocent,In winter, lumberers; in summer, guides;Their sinewy arms pull at the oar untiredThree times ten thousand strokes, from morn to eve.Look to yourselves, ye polished gentlemen!No city airs or arts pass current here.Your rank is all reversed: let men of clothBow to the stalwart churls in overalls:They are the doctors of the wilderness,And we the low-prized laymen.In sooth, red flannel is a saucy testWhich few can put on with impunity.What make you, master, fumbling at the oar?Will you catch crabs? Truth tries pretension here.The sallow knows the basket-maker's thumb;The oar, the guide's. Dare you accept the tasksHe shall impose, to find a spring, trap foxes,Tell the sun's time, determine the true north,Or stumbling on through vast self-similar woodsTo thread by night the nearest way to camp?Ask you, how went the hours?All day we swept the lake, searched every cove,North from Camp Maple, south to Osprey Bay,Watching when the loud dogs should drive in deer,Or whipping its rough surface for a trout;Or bathers, diving from the rock at noon;Challenging Echo by our guns and cries;Or listening to the laughter of the loon;Or, in the evening twilight's latest red,Beholding the procession of the pines;Or, later yet, beneath a lighted jack,In the boat's bows, a silent night-hunterStealing with paddle to the feeding-groundsOf the red deer, to aim at a square mist.Hark to that muffled roar! a tree in the woodsIs fallen: but hush! it has not scared the buckWho stands astonished at the meteor light,Then turns to bound away,--is it too late?Sometimes we tried our rifles at a mark,Six rods, sixteen, twenty, or forty-five;Sometimes our wits at sally and retort,With laughter sudden as the crack of rifle;Or parties scaled the near acclivitiesCompeting seekers of a rumoured lake,Whose unauthenticated waves we namedLake Probability,--our carbuncle,Long sought, not found.Two Doctors in the campDissected the slain deer, weighed the trout's brain,Captured the lizard, salamander, shrew,Crab, mice, snail, dragon-fly, minnow, and moth;Insatiate skill in water or in airWaved the scoop-net, and nothing came amiss;The while, one leaden pot of alcoholGave an impartial tomb to all the kinds.Not less the ambitious botanist sought plants,Orchis and gentian, fern, and long whip-scirpus,Rosy polygonum, lake-margin's pride,Hypnum and hydnum, mushroom, sponge, and moss,Or harebell nodding in the gorge of falls.Above, the eagle flew, the osprey screamed,The raven croaked, owls hooted, the woodpeckerLoud hammered, and the heron rose in the swamp.As water poured through the hollows of the hillsTo feed this wealth of lakes and rivulets,So Nature shed all beauty lavishlyFrom her redundant horn.Lords of this realm,Bounded by dawn and sunset, and the dayRounded by hours where each outdid the lastIn miracles of pomp, we must be proud,As if associates of the sylvan gods.We seemed the dwellers of the zodiac,So pure the Alpine element we breathed,So light, so lofty pictures came and went.We trode on air, contemned the distant town,Its timorous ways, big trifles, and we plannedThat we should build, hard-by, a spacious lodge,And how we should come hither with our sons,Hereafter,--willing they, and more adroit.Hard fare, hard bed, and comic misery,--The midge, the blue-fly, and the mosquitoPainted our necks, hands, ankles, with red bands:But, on the second day, we heed them not,Nay, we saluted them Auxiliaries,Whom earlier we had chid with spiteful names.For who defends our leafy tabernacleFrom bold intrusion of the travelling crowd,--Who but the midge, mosquito, and the fly,Which past endurance sting the tender cit,But which we learn to scatter with a smudge,Or baffle by a veil, or slight by scorn?Our foaming ale we drunk from hunters' pans,Ale, and a sup of wine. Our steward gaveVenison and trout, potatoes, beans, wheat-bread;All ate like abbots, and, if any missedTheir wonted convenance, cheerly hid the lossWith hunters' appetite and peals of mirth.And Stillman, our guides' guide, and Commodore,Crusoe, Crusader, Pius AEneas, said aloud,'Chronic dyspepsia never came from eatingFood indigestible':--then murmured some,Others applauded him who spoke the truth.Nor doubt but visitings of graver thoughtChecked in these souls the turbulent heyday'Mid all the hints and glories of the home.For who can tell what sudden privaciesWere sought and found, amid the hue and cryOf scholars furloughed from their tasks, and letInto this Oreads' fended Paradise,As chapels in the city's thoroughfares,Whither gaunt Labour slips to wipe his brow,And meditate a moment on Heaven's rest.Judge with what sweet surprises Nature spokeTo each apart, lifting her lovely showsTo spiritual lessons pointed home.And as through dreams in watches of the night,So through all creatures in their form and waysSome mystic hint accosts the vigilant,Not clearly voiced, but waking a new senseInviting to new knowledge, one with old.Hark to that petulant chirp! what ails the warbler?Mark his capricious ways to draw the eye.Now soar again. What wilt thou, restless bird,Seeking in that chaste blue a bluer light,Thirsting in that pure for a purer sky?And presently the sky is changed; O world!What pictures and what harmonies are thine!The clouds are rich and dark, the air serene,So like the soul of me, what if't were me?A melancholy better than all mirth.Comes the sweet sadness at the retrospect,Or at the foresight of obscurer years?Like yon slow-sailing cloudy promontory,Whereon the purple iris dwells in beautySuperior to all its gaudy skirts.And, that no day of life may lack romance,The spiritual stars rise nightly, shedding downA private beam into each several heart.Daily the bending skies solicit man,The seasons chariot him from this exile,The rainbow hours bedeck his glowing chair,The storm-winds urge the heavy weeks along,Suns haste to set, that so remoter lightsBeckon the wanderer to his vaster home.With a vermilion pencil mark the dayWhen of our little fleet three cruising skiffsEntering Big Tupper, bound for the foaming FallsOf loud Bog River, suddenly confrontTwo of our mates returning with swift oars.One held a printed journal waving highCaught from a late-arriving traveller,Big with great news, and shouted the reportFor which the world had waited, now firm fact,Of the wire-cable laid beneath the sea,And landed on our coast, and pulsatingWith ductile fire. Loud, exulting criesFrom boat to boat, and to the echoes round,Greet the glad miracle. Thought's new-found pathShall supplement henceforth all trodden ways,Match God's equator with a zone of art,And lift man's public action to a heightWorthy the enormous clouds of witnesses,When linked hemispheres attest his deed.We have few moments in the longest lifeOf such delight and wonder as there grew,--Nor yet unsuited to that solitude:A burst of joy, as if we told the factTo ears intelligent; as if gray rockAnd cedar grove and cliff and lake should knowThis feat of wit, this triumph of mankind;As if we men were talking in a veinOf sympathy so large, that ours was theirs,And a prime end of the most subtle elementWere fairly reached at last. Wake, echoing caves!Bend nearer, faint day-moon! Yon thundertops,Let them hear well! 't is theirs as much as ours.A spasm throbbing through the pedestalsOf Alp and Andes, isle and continent,Urging astonished Chaos with a thrillTo be a brain, or serve the brain of man.The lightning has run masterless too long;He must to school, and learn his verb and noun,And teach his nimbleness to earn his wage,Spelling with guided tongue man's messagesShot through the weltering pit of the salt sea.And yet I marked, even in the manly joyOf our great-hearted Doctor in his boat,(Perchance I erred,) a shade of discontent;Or was it for mankind a generous shame,As of a luck not quite legitimate,Since fortune snatched from wit the lion's part?Was it a college pique of town and gown,As one within whose memory it burnedThat not academicians, but some lout,Found ten years since the Californian gold?And now, again, a hungry companyOf traders, led by corporate sons of trade,Perversely borrowing from the shop the toolsOf science, not from the philosophers,Had won the brightest laurel of all time.'Twas always thus, and will be; hand and headAre ever rivals: but, though this be swift,The other slow,--this the Prometheus,And that the Jove,--yet, howsoever hid,It was from Jove the other stole his fire,And, without Jove, the good had never been.It is not Iroquois or cannibals,But ever the free race with front sublime,And these instructed by their wisest too,Who do the feat, and lift humanity.Let not him mourn who best entitled was,Nay, mourn not one: let him exult,Yea, plant the tree that bears best apples, plant,And water it with wine, nor watch askanceWhether thy sons or strangers eat the fruit:Enough that mankind eat, and are refreshed.We flee away from cities, but we bringThe best of cities with us, these learned classifiers,Men knowing what they seek, armed eyes of experts.We praise the guide, we praise the forest life;But will we sacrifice our dear-bought loreOf books and arts and trained experiment,Or count the Sioux a match for Agassiz?O no, not we! Witness the shout that shookWild Tupper Lake; witness the mute all-hailThe joyful traveller gives, when on the vergeOf craggy Indian wilderness he hearsFrom a log-cabin stream Beethoven's notesOn the piano, played with master's hand.'Well done!' he cries; 'the bear is kept at bay,The lynx, the rattlesnake, the flood, the fire;All the fierce enemies, ague, hunger, cold,This thin spruce roof, this clayed log-wall,This wild plantation will suffice to chase.Now speed the gay celerities of art,What in the desert was impossibleWithin four walls is possible again,--Culture and libraries, mysteries of skill,Traditioned fame of masters, eager strifeOf keen competing youths, joined or aloneTo outdo each other, and extort applause.Mind wakes a new-born giant from her sleep.Twirl the old wheels? Time takes fresh start againOn for a thousand years of genius more.'The holidays were fruitful, but must end;One August evening had a cooler breath;Into each mind intruding duties crept;Under the cinders burned the fires of home;Nay, letters found us in our paradise;So in the gladness of the new eventWe struck our camp, and left the happy hills.The fortunate star that rose on us sank not;The prodigal sunshine rested on the land,The rivers gambolled onward to the sea,And Nature, the inscrutable and mute,Permitted on her infinite reposeAlmost a smile to steal to cheer her sons,As if one riddle of the Sphinx were guessed.                                                 Of Paradise, O hermit wise,Let us renounce the thought.Of old therein our names of sinAllah recorded not.Who dear to God on earthly sodNo corn-grain plants,The same is glad that life is had,Though corn he wants.Thy mind the mosque and cool kiosk,Spare fast, and orisons;Mine me allows the drink-house,And sweet chase of the nuns.O just fakeer, with brow austere,Forbid me not the vine;On the first day, poor Hafiz clayWas kneaded up with wine.He is no dervise, Heaven slights his service,Who shall refuseThere in the banquet, to pawn his blanketFor Schiraz's juice.Who his friend's shirt, or hem of his shirt,Shall spare to pledge,To him Eden's bliss and Angel's kissShall want their edge.Up, Hafiz; grace from high God's faceBeams on thee pure;Shy then not hell, and trust thou well,Heaven is secure.                                                 Thee, dear friend, a brother soothes,Not with flatteries, but truths,Which tarnish not, but purifyTo light which dims the morning's eye.I have come from the spring-woods,From the fragrant solitudes;Listen what the poplar tree,And murmuring waters counselled me.If with love thy heart has burned,If thy love is unreturned,Hide thy grief within thy breast,Though it tear thee unexpressed.For, when love has once departedFrom the eyes of the false-hearted,And one by one has torn off quiteThe bandages of purple light,Though thou weft the loveliestForm the Soul had ever dressed,Thou shalt seem in each replyA vixen to his altered eye;Thy softest pleadings seem too bold,Thy praying lute shall seem to scold.Though thou kept the straightest road,Yet thou errest far and broad.But thou shalt do as do the godsIn their cloudless periods:For of this lore be thou sure,Though thou forget, the gods secureForget never their command,But make the statute of this land:As they lead, so follow all,Ever have done, ever shall.Warning to the blind and deaf,'Tis written on the iron leaf, Who drinks of Cupid's nectar cup Loveth downward and not up;Therefore who loves, of gods or men,Shall not by the same be loved again;His sweetheart's idolatryFalls in turn a new degree.When a god is once beguiledBy beauty of a mortal child,And by her radiant youth delighted,He is not fooled, but warily knoweth,His love shall never be requited;And thus the wise Immortal doeth.'Tis his study and delightTo bless that creature, day and night,From all evils to defend her,In her lap to pour all splendor,To ransack earth for riches rare,And fetch her stars to deck her hair;He mixes music with her thoughts,And saddens her with heavenly doubts;All grace, all good his great heart knows,Profuse in love the king bestows,Saying, Hearken, Earth! Sea! Air!This monument of my despairBuild I to the All-Good, All-Fair.Not for a private good,But I from my beatitude,Albeit scorned as none was scorned,Adorn her as was none adorned.I make this maiden an ensample To nature through her kingdoms ample,Whereby to model newer races,Statelier forms, and fairer faces,To carry man to new degreesOf power, and of comeliness.These presents be the hostagesWhich I pawn for my release;See to thyself, O universe!Thou art better and not worse. —And the god having given all,Is freed forever from his thrall.                                                 I am the Muse who sung alwayBy Jove, at dawn of the first day.Star-crowned, sole-sitting, long I wroughtTo fire the stagnant earth with thought:On spawning slime my song prevails,Wolves shed their fangs, and dragons scales;Flushed in the sky the sweet May-morn,Earth smiled with flowers, and man was born.Then Asia yeaned her shepherd race,And Nile substructs her granite base,--Tented Tartary, columned Nile,--And, under vines, on rocky isle,Or on wind-blown sea-marge bleak,Forward stepped the perfect Greek:That wit and joy might find a tongue,And earth grow civil, HOMER Sung.Flown to Italy from Greece,I brooded long, and held my peace,For I am wont to sing uncalled,And in days of evil plightUnlock doors of new delight;And sometimes mankind I appalledWith a bitter horoscope,With spasms of terror for balm of hope.Then by better thought I leadBards to speak what nations need;So I folded me in fears,And DANTE searched the triple spheres,Moulding nature at his will,So shaped, so coloured, swift or still,And, sculptor-like, his large designEtched on Alp and Apennine.Seethed in mists of Penmanmaur,Taught by Plinlimmon's Druid power,England's genius filled all measureOf heart and soul, of strength and pleasure,Gave to the mind its emperor,And life was larger than before:Nor sequent centuries could hitOrbit and sum of SHAKSPEARE's wit.The men who lived with him becamePoets, for the air was fame.Far in the North, where polar nightHolds in check the frolic light,In trance upborne past mortal goalThe Swede EMANUEL leads the soul.Through snows above, mines underground,The inks of Erebus he found;Rehearsed to men the damned wailsOn which the seraph music sails,In spirit-worlds he trod alone,But walked the earth unmarked, unknown.The near by-stander caught no sound,--Yet they who listened far aloofHeard rendings of the skyey roof,And felt, beneath, the quaking ground;And his air-sown, unheeded words,In the next age, are flaming swords.In newer days of war and trade,Romance forgot, and faith decayed,When Science armed and guided war,And clerks the Janus-gates unbar,When France, where poet never grew,Halved and dealt the globe anew,GOETHE, raised o'er joy and strife,Drew the firm lines of Fate and Life,And brought Olympian wisdom downTo court and mart, to gown and town,Stooping, his finger wrote in clayThe open secret of to-day.So bloom the unfading petals five,And verses that all verse outlive.                                                 Every day brings a ship,Every ship brings a word;Well for those who have no fear,Looking seaward well assuredThat the word the vessel bringsIs the word they wish to hear.                                                 I.Low and mournful be the strain,Haughty thought be far from me;Tones of penitence and pain,Moanings of the tropic sea;Low and tender in the cellWhere a captive sits in chains,Crooning ditties treasured wellFrom his Afric's torrid plains.Sole estate his sire bequeathed--Hapless sire to hapless son--Was the wailing song he breathed,And his chain when life was done.What his fault, or what his crime?Or what ill planet crossed his prime?Heart too soft and will too weakTo front the fate that crouches near,--Dove beneath the vulture's beak;--Will song dissuade the thirsty spear?Dragged from his mother's arms and breast,Displaced, disfurnished here,His wistful toil to do his bestChilled by a ribald jeer.Great men in the Senate sate,Sage and hero, side by side,Building for their sons the State,Which they shall rule with pride.They forbore to break the chainWhich bound the dusky tribe,Checked by the owners' fierce disdain,Lured by 'Union' as the bribe.Destiny sat by, and said,'Pang for pang your seed shall pay,Hide in false peace your coward head,I bring round the harvest-day.'II.Freedom all winged expands,Nor perches in a narrow place;Her broad van seeks unplanted lands;She loves a poor and virtuous race.Clinging to a colder zoneWhose dark sky sheds the snow-flake down,The snow-flake is her banner's star,Her stripes the boreal streamers are.Long she loved the Northman well:Now the iron age is done,She will not refuse to dwellWith the offspring of the Sun;Foundling of the desert far,Where palms plume, siroccos blaze,He roves unhurt the burning waysIn climates of the summer star.He has avenues to GodHid from men of Northern brain,Far beholding, without cloud,What these with slowest steps attain.If once the generous chief arriveTo lead him willing to be led,For freedom he will strike and strive,And drain his heart till he be dead.III.In an age of fops and toys,Wanting wisdom, void of right,Who shall nerve heroic boysTo hazard all in Freedom's fight,--Break sharply off their jolly games,Forsake their comrades gay,And quit proud homes and youthful dames,For famine, toil, and fray?Yet on the nimble air benignSpeed nimbler messages,That waft the breath of grace divineTo hearts in sloth and ease.So nigh is grandeur to our dust,So near is God to man,When Duty whispers low, Thou must,The youth replies, I can.IV.O, well for the fortunate soulWhich Music's wings infold,Stealing away the memoryOf sorrows new and old!Yet happier he whose inward sight,Stayed on his subtile thought,Shuts his sense on toys of time,To vacant bosoms brought.But best befriended of the GodHe who, in evil times,Warned by an inward voice,Heeds not the darkness and the dread,Biding by his rule and choice,Feeling only the fiery threadLeading over heroic ground,Walled with mortal terror round,To the aim which him allures,And the sweet heaven his deed secures.Stainless soldier on the walls,Knowing this,--and knows no more,--Whoever fights, whoever falls,Justice conquers evermore, Justice after as before,--And he who battles on her side,God, though he were ten times slain,Crowns him victor glorified,Victor over death and pain;Forever: but his erring foe,Self-assured that he prevails,Looks from his victim lying low,And sees aloft the red right armRedress the eternal scales.He, the poor foe, whom angels foil,Blind with pride, and fooled by hate,Writhes within the dragon coil,Reserved to a speechless fate.V.Blooms the laurel which belongsTo the valiant chief who fights;I see the wreath, I hear the songsLauding the Eternal Rights,Victors over daily wrongs:Awful victors, they misguideWhom they will destroy,And their coming triumph hideIn our downfall, or our joy:They reach no term, they never sleep,In equal strength through space abide;Though, feigning dwarfs, they crouch and creep,The strong they slay, the swift outstride:Fate's grass grows rank in valley clods,And rankly on the castled steep,--Speak it firmly, these are gods,All are ghosts beside.                                                 LONG I followed happy guides,I could never reach their sides;Their step is forth, and, ere the dayBreaks up their leaguer, and away.Keen my sense, my heart was young, Right good-will my sinews strung,But no speed of mine availsTo hunt upon their shining trails.On and away, their hasting feetMake the morning proud and sweet; Flowers they strew,—I catch the scent;Or tone of silver instrumentLeaves on the wind melodious trace;Yet I could never see their face.On eastern hills I see their smokes, Mixed with mist by distant lochs.I met many travellersWho the road had surely kept;They saw not my fine revellers,—These had crossed them while they slept. Some had heard their fair report,In the country or the court.Fleetest couriers aliveNever yet could once arrive,As they went or they returned, At the house where these sojourned.Sometimes their strong speed they slacken.Though they are not overtaken;In sleep their jubilant troop is near,—I tuneful voices overhear; It may be in wood or waste,—At unawares ’t is come and past.Their near camp my spirit knowsBy signs gracious as rainbows.I thenceforward and long after, Listen for their harp-like laughterAnd carry in my heart, for days,Peace that hallows rudest ways.                                                 To laugh often and much; to win the respect of the intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others;  to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch,or a redeemed social condition; to know that one life has breathed easier  because you lived here. This is to have succeeded.                                                 I rake no coffined clay, nor publish wideThe resurrection of departed pride.Safe in their ancient crannies, dark and deep,Let kings and conquerors, saints and soldiers sleep-Late in the world,-too late perchance for fame,Just late enough to reap abundant blame,-I choose a novel theme, a bold abuseOf critic charters, an unlaurelled Muse.Old mouldy men and books and names and landsDisgust my reason and defile my hands.I had as lief respect an ancient shoe,As love old things for age, and hate the new.I spurn the Past, my mind disdains its nod,Nor kneels in homage to so mean a God.I laugh at those who, while they gape and gaze,The bald antiquity of China praise.Youth is (whatever cynic tubs pretend)The fault that boys and nations soonest mend.                                                 Your picture smiles as first it smiled,The ring you gave is still the same,Your letter tells, O changing child,No tidings since it came.Give me an amuletThat keeps intelligence with you,Red when you love, and rosier red,And when you love not, pale and blue.Alas, that neither bonds nor vowsCan certify possession;Torments me still the fear that loveDied in its last expression.                                                 At anchor in Hampton Roads we lay, On board of the Cumberland, sloop-of-war; And at times from the fortress across the bay The alarum of drums swept past, Or a bugle blast From the camp on the shore. Then far away to the south uprose A little feather of snow-white smoke, And we knew that the iron ship of our foes Was steadily steering its course To try the force Of our ribs of oak. Down upon us heavily runs, Silent and sullen, the floating fort; Then comes a puff of smoke from her guns, And leaps the terrible death, With fiery breath, From each open port. We are not idle, but send her straight Defiance back in a full broadside! As hail rebounds from a roof of slate, Rebounds our heavier hail From each iron scale Of the monster's hide. 'Strike your flag!' the rebel cries, In his arrogant old plantation strain. 'Never!' our gallant Morris replies; 'It is better to sink than to yield!' And the whole air pealed With the cheers of our men. Then, like a kraken huge and black, She crushed our ribs in her iron grasp! Down went the Cumberland all a wrack, With a sudden shudder of death, And the cannon's breath For her dying gasp. Next morn, as the sun rose over the bay, Still floated our flag at the mainmast head. Lord, how beautiful was Thy day! Every waft of the air Was a whisper of prayer, Or a dirge for the dead. Ho! brave hearts that went down in the seas! Ye are at peace in the troubled stream; Ho! brave land! with hearts like these, Thy flag, that is rent in twain, Shall be one again, And without a seam!                                                 Grace, Beauty, and CapriceBuild this golden portal;Graceful women, chosen men,Dazzle every mortal.Their sweet and lofty countenanceHis enchanted food;He need not go to them, their formsBeset his solitude.He looketh seldom in their face,His eyes explore the ground,--The green grass is a looking-glassWhereon their traits are found.Little and less he says to them,So dances his heart in his breast;Their tranquil mien bereaveth himOf wit, of words, of rest.Too weak to win, too fond to shunThe tyrants of his doom,The much deceived EndymionSlips behind a tomb.                                                 Roving, roving, as it seems,Una lights my clouded dreams;Still for journeys she is dressed;We wander far by east and west.In the homestead, homely thought;At my work I ramble not;If from home chance draw me wide,Half-seen Una sits beside.In my house and garden-plot,Though beloved, I miss her not;But one I seek in foreign places,One face explore in foreign faces.At home a deeper thought may lightThe inward sky with chrysolite,And I greet from far the ray,Aurora of a dearer day.But if upon the seas I sail,Or trundle on the glowing rail,I am but a thought of hers,Loveliest of travellers.So the gentle poet's nameTo foreign parts is blown by fame;Seek him in his native town,He is hidden and unknown.                                                 Butler, fetch the ruby wine,Which with sudden greatness fills us;Pour for me who in my spiritFail in courage and performance;Bring the philosophic stone,Karun's treasure, Noah's life;Haste, that by thy means I openAll the doors of luck and life.Bring me, boy, the fire-waterZoroaster sought in dust.To Hafiz revelling 'tis allowedTo pray to Matter and to Fire.Bring the wine of Jamschid's glassThat shone, ere time was, in the Néant.Give it me, that through its virtueI, as Jamschid, see through worlds.Wisely said the Kaiser Jamschid,This world's not worth a barleycorn.Bring me, boy, the nectar cup,Since it leads to Paradise.Flute and lyre lordly speak,Lees of wine outvalue crowns.Hither bring the veiled beautyWho in ill-famed houses sits:Lead her forth: my honest nameFreely barter I for wine.Bring me, boy, the fire-water,Drinks the lion—the woods burn.Give it me, that I storm heaven,Tear the net from the arch-wolf.Wine, wherewith the Houris teachAngels the ways of Paradise.On the glowing coals I'll set it,And therewith my brain perfume.Bring me wine, through whose effulgenceJam and Chosroes yielded light:Wine, that to the flute I singWhere is Jam, and where is Kauss.Bring the blessing of old times;Bless the old departed Shahs;Bring it me, the Shah of hearts.Bring me wine to wash me clean,Of the weather-stains of care,See the countenance of luck.While I dwell in spirit-gardens,Wherefore sit I shackled here?Lo, this mirror shows me all.Drunk, I speak of purity,Beggar, I of lordship speak.When Hafiz in his revel sings,Shouteth Sohra in her sphere.Fear the changes of a day:Bring wine which increases life,Since the world is all untrue,Let the trumpets thee remindHow the crown of Kobad vanished.Be not certain of the world;'Twill not spare to shed thy blood.Desperate of the world's affair,Came I running to the wine-house.Give me wine which maketh glad,That I may my steed bestride,Through the course career with Rustem,Gallop to my heart's content.Give me, boy, the ruby cupWhich unlocks the heart with wine,That I reason quite renounce,And plant banners on the worlds.Let us make our glasses kiss,Let us quench the sorrow-cinders:To-day let us drink together.Whoso has a banquet dressed,Is with glad mind satisfied,'Scaping from the snares of Dews.Alas for youth! 'tis gone in wind,—Happy he who spent it well.Give me wine, that I o'erleapBoth worlds at a single spring,Stole at dawn from glowing spheresCall of Houris to mine ear;'O happy bird! delicious soul!Spread thy pinion, break the cage;Sit on the roof of the seven domes,Where the spirit takes repose.'In the time of Bisurdschimihr,Menutscheher's beauty shined,On the beaker of Nushirvan,Wrote they once in eider times,'Hear the Counsel, learn from usSample of the course of things;Earth, it is a place of sorrow,Scanty joys are here below,Who has nothing, has no sorrow.'Where is Jam, and where his cup?Solomon, and his mirror where?Which of the wise masters knowsWhat time Kauss and Jam existed?When those heroes left this world,Left they nothing but their names.Bind thy heart not to the earth,When thou goest, come not back.Fools squander on the world their hearts.League with it, is feud with heaven;Never gives it what thou wishest.A cup of wine imparts the sightOf the five heaven-domes with nine steps:Whoso can himself renounce,Without support shall walk thereon.Who discreet is, is not wise.Give me, boy, the Kaiser cup,Which rejoices heart and soul;Under type of wine and cupSignify we purest love.Youth like lightning disappears,Life goes by us as the wind:Leave the dwelling with six doors,And the serpent with nine heads;Life and silver spend thou freely,If thou honorest the soul.Haste into the other life;All is nought save God alone.Give me, boy, this toy of dæmons.When the cup of Jam was lost,Him availed the world no more.Fetch the wine-glass made of ice,Wake the torpid heart with wine.Every clod of loam below usIs a skull of Alexander;Oceans are the blood of princes;Desert sands the dust of beauties.More than one Darius was thereWho the whole world overcame;But since these gave up the ghost,Thinkest thou they never were?Boy, go from me to the Shah,Say to him: Shah crowned as Jam,Win thou first the poor man's heart,Then the glass; so know the world.Empty sorrows from the earthCanst thou drive away with wine.Now in thy throne's recent beauty,In the flowing tide of power,Moon of fortune, mighty king,Whose tiara sheddeth lustre,Peace secure to fish and fowl,Heart and eye-sparkle to saints;Shoreless is the sea of praise,—I content me with a prayer.From Nisami's poet-works,Highest ornament of speech,Here a verse will I recite,Verse as beautiful as pearls.'More kingdoms wait thy diadem,Than are known to thee by name;May the sovran destinyGrant a victory every morn!'                                                 You shall not be overboldWhen you deal with arctic cold,As late I found my lukewarm bloodChilled wading in the snow-choked wood.How should I fight? my foeman fineHas million arms to one of mine:East, west, for aid I looked in vain,East, west, north, south, are his domain.Miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;Must borrow his winds who there would come.Up and away for life! be fleet!--The frost-king ties my fumbling feet,Sings in my ears, my hands are stones,Curdles the blood to the marble bones,Tugs at the heart-strings, numbs the sense,And hems in life with narrowing fence.Well, in this broad bed lie and sleep,The punctual stars will vigil keep,Embalmed by purifying cold,The winds shall sing their dead-march old,The snow is no ignoble shroud,The moon thy mourner, and the cloud.Softly,--but this way fate was pointing,'T was coming fast to such anointing,When piped a tiny voice hard by,Gay and polite a cheerful cry,Chic-chicadeedee! saucy noteOut of sound heart and merry throat,As if it said, 'Good day, good sir!Fine afternoon, old passenger!Happy to meet you in these places,Where January brings few faces.'This poet, though he live apart,Moved by his hospitable heart,Sped, when I passed his sylvan fort,To do the honours of his court,As fits a feathered lord of land;Flew near, with soft wing grazed my hand,Hopped on the bough, then, darting low,Prints his small impress on the snow,Shows feats of his gymnastic play,Head downward, clinging to the spray.Here was this atom in full breath,Hurling defiance at vast death;This scrap of valour just for playFronts the north-wind in waistcoat gray,As if to shame my weak behaviour;I greeted loud my little saviour,'You pet! what dost here? and what for?In these woods, thy small Labrador,At this pinch, wee San Salvador!What fire burns in that little chestSo frolic, stout, and self-possest?Henceforth I wear no stripe but thine;Ashes and jet all hues outshine.Why are not diamonds black and gray,To ape thy dare-devil array?And I affirm, the spacious NorthExists to draw thy virtue forth.I think no virtue goes with size;The reason of all cowardiceIs, that men are overgrown,And, to be valiant, must come downTo the titmouse dimension.''T is good-will makes intelligence,And I began to catch the senseOf my bird's song: 'Live out of doors,In the great woods, on prairie floors.I dine in the sun; when he sinks in the sea,I too have a hole in a hollow tree;And I like less when Summer beatsWith stifling beams on these retreats,Than noontide twilights which snow makesWith tempest of the blinding flakes.For well the soul, if stout within,Can arm impregnably the skin;And polar frost my frame defied,Made of the air that blows outside.'With glad remembrance of my debt,I homeward turn; farewell, my pet!When here again thy pilgrim comes,He shall bring store of seeds and crumbs.Doubt not, so long as earth has bread,Thou first and foremost shalt be fed;The Providence that is most largeTakes hearts like thine in special charge,Helps who for their own need are strong,And the sky dotes on cheerful song.Henceforth I prize thy wiry chantO'er all that mass and minster vaunt;For men mis-hear thy call in spring,As 't would accost some frivolous wing;Crying out of the hazel copse, Phe-be!And, in winter, Chic-a-dee-dee!I think old Caesar must have heardIn northern Gaul my dauntless bird,And, echoed in some frosty wold,Borrowed thy battle-numbers bold.And I will write our annals new,And thank thee for a better clew,I, who dreamed not when I came hereTo find the antidote of fear,Now hear thee say in Roman key,Paean! Veni, vidi, vici.                                                 I hung my verses in the wind,Time and tide their faults may find.All were winnowed through and through,Five lines lasted sound and true;Five were smelted in a potThan the South more fierce and hot;These the siroc could not melt,Fire their fiercer flaming felt,And the meaning was more whiteThan July's meridian light.Sunshine cannot bleach the snow,Nor time unmake what poets know.Have you eyes to find the fiveWhich five hundred did survive?                                                 Good Heart, that ownest all!I ask a modest boon and small:Not of lands and towns the gift,--Too large a load for me to lift,--But for one proper creature,Which geographic eye,Sweeping the map of Western earth,Or the Atlantic coast, from MaineTo Powhatan's domain,Could not descry.Is't much to ask in all thy huge creation,So trivial a part,--A solitary heart?Yet count me not of spirit mean,Or mine a mean demand,For 't is the concentrationAnd worth of all the land,The sister of the sea,The daughter of the strand,Composed of air and light,And of the swart earth-might.So little to thy poet's prayerThy large bounty well can spare.And yet I think, if she were gone,The world were better left alone.                                                 AND when I am entombèd in my place,Be it remembered of a single man,He never, though he dearly loved his race,For fear of human eyes swerved from his plan.OH what is Heaven but the fellowshipOf minds that each can stand against the worldBy its own meek and incorruptible will?THE days pass over meAnd I am still the same;The aroma of my life is goneWith the flower with which it came.                                                 I mourn upon this battle-field,But not for those who perished here.Behold the river-bankWhither the angry farmers came,In sloven dress and broken rank,Nor thought of fame.Their deed of bloodAll mankind praise;Even the serene Reason says,It was well done.The wise and simple have one glanceTo greet yon stern head-stone,Which more of pride than pity gaveTo mark the Briton's friendless grave.Yet it is a stately tomb;The grand returnOf eve and morn,The year's fresh bloom,The silver cloud,Might grace the dust that is most proud.Yet not of these I museIn this ancestral place,But of a kindred faceThat never joy or hope shall here diffuse.Ah, brother of the brief but blazing star!What hast thou to do with theseHaunting this bank's historic trees?Thou born for noblest life,For action's field, for victor's car,Thou living champion of the right?To these their penalty belonged:I grudge not these their bed of death,But thine to thee, who never wrongedThe poorest that drew breath.All inborn power that couldConsist with homage to the goodFlamed from his martial eye;He who seemed a soldier born,He should have the helmet worn,All friends to fend, all foes defy,Fronting foes of God and man,Frowning down the evil-doer,Battling for the weak and poor.His from youth the leader's lookGave the law which others took,And never poor beseeching glanceShamed that sculptured countenance.There is no record left on earth,Save in tablets of the heart,Of the rich inherent worth,Of the grace that on him shone,Of eloquent lips, of joyful wit;He could not frame a word unfit,An act unworthy to be done;Honour prompted every glance,Honour came and sat beside him,In lowly cot or painful road,And evermore the cruel godCried, 'Onward!' and the palm-crown showed.Born for success he seemed,With grace to win, with heart to hold,With shining gifts that took all eyes,With budding power in college-halls,As pledged in coming days to forgeWeapons to guard the State, or scourgeTyrants despite their guards or walls.On his young promise Beauty smiled,Drew his free homage unbeguiled,And prosperous Age held out his hand,And richly his large future planned,And troops of friends enjoyed the tide,--All, all was given, and only health denied.I see him with superior smileHunted by Sorrow's grisly trainIn lands remote, in toil and pain,With angel patience labour on,With the high port he wore erewhile,When, foremost of the youthful band,The prizes in all lists he won;Nor bate one jot of heart or hope,And, least of all, the loyal tieWhich holds to home 'neath every sky,The joy and pride the pilgrim feelsIn hearts which round the hearth at homeKeep pulse for pulse with those who roam.What generous beliefs consoleThe brave whom Fate denies the goal!If others reach it, is content;To Heaven's high will his will is bent.Firm on his heart relied,What lot soe'er betide,Work of his handHe nor repents nor grieves,Pleads for itself the fact,As unrepenting Nature leavesHer every act.Fell the bolt on the branching oak;The rainbow of his hope was broke;No craven cry, no secret tear,--He told no pang, he knew no fear;Its peace sublime his aspect kept,His purpose woke, his features slept;And yet between the spasms of painHis genius beamed with joy again.O'er thy rich dust the endless smileOf Nature in thy Spanish isleHints never loss or cruel breakAnd sacrifice for love's dear sake,Nor mourn the unalterable DaysThat Genius goes and Folly stays.What matters how, or from what ground,The freed soul its Creator found?Alike thy memory embalmsThat orange-grove, that isle of palms,And these loved banks, whose oak-boughs boldRoot in the blood of heroes old.                                                 I WHEN the pine tosses its conesTo the song of its waterfall tones,Who speeds to the woodland walks?To birds and trees who talks?Cæsar of his leafy Rome,There the poet is at home.He goes to the river-side,—Not hook nor line hath he;He stands in the meadows wide,—Nor gun nor scythe to see. Sure some god his eye enchants:What he knows nobody wants.In the wood he travels glad,Without better fortune had,Melancholy without bad.Knowledge this man prizes bestSeems fantastic to the rest:Pondering shadows, colors, clouds,Grass-buds and caterpillar-shrouds,Boughs on which the wild bees settle,Tints that spot the violet's petal,Why Nature loves the number five,And why the star-form she repeats: Lover of all things alive,Wonderer at all he meets,Wonderer chiefly at himself,Who can tell him what he is?Or how meet in human elfComing and past eternities?2And such I knew, a forest seer,A minstrel of the natural year,Foreteller of the vernal ides,Wise harbinger of spheres and tides,A lover true, who knew by heartEach joy the mountain dales impart;It seemed that Nature could not raiseA plant in any secret place,In quaking bog, on snowy hill,Beneath the grass that shades the rill,Under the snow, between the rocks,In damp fields known to bird and fox.But he would come in the very hourIt opened in its virgin bower,As if a sunbeam showed the place,And tell its long-descended race.It seemed as if the breezes brought him,It seemed as if the sparrows taught him;As if by secret sight he knewWhere, in far fields, the orchis grew.Many haps fall in the fieldSeldom seen by wishful eyes,But all her shows did Nature yield,To please and win this pilgrim wise.He saw the partridge drum in the woods;He heard the woodcock's evening hymn;He found the tawny thrushes' broods;And the shy hawk did wait for him;What others did at distance hear,And guessed within the thicket's gloom,Was shown to this philosopher,And at his bidding seemed to come. 3In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gangWhere from a hundred lakes young rivers sprang;He trod the unplanted forest floor, whereonThe all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone;Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear,And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds,The slight Linnæa hang its twin-born heads,And blessed the monument of the man of flowers,Which breathes his sweet fame'through the northern bowers.He heard, when in the grove, at intervals,With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls,—One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree,Declares the close of its green century.Low lies the plant to whose creation wentSweet influence from every element;Whose living towers the years conspired to build,Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild.Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed,He roamed, content alike with man and beast.Where darkness found him he lay glad at night;There the red morning touched him with its light.Three moons his great heart him a hermit made,So long he roved at will the boundless shade.The timid it concerns to ask their way,And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray,To make no step until the event is known,And ills to come as evils past bemoan.Not so the wise; no coward watch he keepsTo spy what danger on his pathway creeps;Go where he will, the wise man is at home,His hearth the earth,—his hall the azure dome;Where his clear spirit leads him, there's his roadBy God's own light illumined and foreshowed.4'T was one of the charmèd daysWhen the genius of God doth flow;The wind may alter twenty ways,A tempest cannot blow;It may blow north, it still is warm;Or south, it still is clear;Or east, it smells like a clover-farm;Or west, no thunder fear. The musing peasant, lowly great,Beside the forest water sate;The rope-like pine-roots crosswise grownComposed the network of his throne;The wide lake, edged with sand and grass,Was burnished to a floor of glass,Painted with shadows green and proudOf the tree and of the cloud. He was the heart of all the scene;On him the sun looked more serene;To hill and cloud his face was known,—It seemed the likeness of their own;They knew by secret sympathyThe public child of earth and sky.'You ask,' he said,'what guideMe through trackless thickets led,Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide.I found the water's bed.The watercourses were my guide;I travelled grateful by their side,Or through their channel dry;They led me through the thicket damp,Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp,Through beds of granite cut my road,And their resistless friendship showed.The falling waters led me,The foodful waters fed me,And brought me to the lowest landUnerring to the ocean sand.The moss upon the forest barkWas pole-star when the night was dark;The purple berries in the woodSupplied me necessary food;For Nature ever faithful isTo such as trust her faithfulness.When the forest shall mislead me,When the night and morning lie,When sea and land refuse to feed me,'T will be time enough to die;Then will yet my mother yieldA pillow in her greenest field,Nor the June flowers scorn to coverThe clay of their departed lover.'II As sunbeams stream through liberal space And nothing jostle or displace, So waved the pine-tree through my thought And fanned the dreams it never brought. 'Whether is better, the gift or the donor?Come to me,'Quoth the pine-tree,'I am the giver of honor.My garden is the cloven rock,And my manure the snow;And drifting sand-heaps feed my stock,In summer's scorching glow. He is great who can live by me:The rough and bearded foresterIs better than the lord;God fills the scrip and canister,Sin piles the loaded board.The lord is the peasant that was,The peasant the lord that shall be;The lord is hay, the peasant grass,One dry, and one the living tree. Who liveth by the ragged pineFoundeth a heroic line;Who liveth in the palace hallWaneth fast and spendeth all.He goes to my savage haunts,With his chariot and his care;My twilight realm he disenchants,And finds his prison there.'What prizes the town and the tower?Only what the pine-tree yields;Sinew that subdued the fields;The wild-eyed boy, who in the woodsChants his hymn to hills and floods,Whom the city's poisoning spleenMade not pale, or fat, or lean;Whom the rain and the wind purgeth,Whom the dawn and the day-star urgeth,In whose cheek the rose-leaf blusheth,In whose feet the lion rusheth,Iron arms, and iron mould,That know not fear, fatigue, or cold.I give my rafters to his boat,My billets to his boiler's throat,And I will swim the ancient seaTo float my child to victory,And grant to dwellers with the pineDominion o'er the palm and vine.Who leaves the pine-tree, leaves his friend,Unnerves his strength, invites his end.Cut a bough from my parent stem,And dip it in thy porcelain vase;A little while each russet gemWill swell and rise with wonted grace;But when it seeks enlarged supplies,The orphan of the forest dies.Whoso walks in solitudeAnd inhabiteth the wood,Choosing light, wave, rock and bird,Before the money-loving herd,Into that forester shall pass,From these companions, power and grace. Clean shall he be, without, within,From the old adhering sin,All ill dissolving in the lightOf his triumphant piercing sight:Not vain, sour, nor frivolous;Not mad, athirst, nor garrulous;Grave, chaste, contented, though retired,And of all other men desired.On him the light of star and moonShall fall with purer radiance down;All constellations of the skyShed their virtue through his eye.Him Nature giveth for defenceHis formidable innocence;The mounting sap, the shells, the sea,All spheres, all stones, his helpers be;He shall meet the speeding year,Without wailing, without fear;He shall be happy in his love,Like to like shall joyful prove;He shall be happy whilst he wooes,Muse-born, a daughter of the Muse.But if with gold she bind her hair,And deck her breast with diamond,Take off thine eyes, thy heart forbear,Though thou lie alone on the ground.' Heed the old oracles,Ponder my spells;Song wakes in my pinnaclesWhen the wind swells.Soundeth the prophetic wind,The shadows shake on the rock behind,And the countless leaves of the pine are stringsTuned to the lay the wood-god sings.Hearken! Hearken!If thou wouldst know the mystic songChanted when the sphere was young.Aloft, abroad, the pæan swells;O wise man! hear'st thou half it tells?O wise man! hear'st thou the least part?'T is the chronicle of art.To the open ear it singsSweet the genesis of things, Of tendency through endless ages,Of star-dust, and star-pilgrimages,Of rounded worlds, of space and time,Of the old flood's subsiding slime,Of chemic matter, force and form,Of poles and powers, cold, wet, and warm:The rushing metamorphosisDissolving all that fixture is,Melts things that be to things that seem,And solid nature to a dream. O, listen to the undersong,The ever old, the ever young;And, far within those cadent pauses,The chorus of the ancient Causes!Delights the dreadful DestinyTo fling his voice into the tree,And shock thy weak ear with a noteBreathed from the everlasting throat.In music he repeats the pangWhence the fair flock of Nature sprang.O mortal! thy ears are stones;These echoes are laden with tonesWhich only the pure can hear;Thou canst not catch what they reciteOf Fate and Will, of Want and Right,Of man to come, of human life,Of Death and Fortune, Growth and Strife.'Once again the pine-tree sung:—' Speak not thy speech my boughs among:Put off thy years, wash in the breeze;My hours are peaceful centuries.Talk no more with feeble tongue;No more the fool of space and time,Come weave with mine a nobler rhyme.Only thy AmericansCan read thy line, can meet thy glance,But the runes that I rehearseUnderstands the universe;The least breath my boughs which tossedBrings again the Pentecost;To every soul resounding clearIn a voice of solemn cheer,—'Am I not thine? Are not these thine?'And they reply, 'Forever mine!'My branches speak Italian,English, German, Basque, Castilian,Mountain speech to Highlanders,Ocean tongues to islanders,To Fin and Lap and swart Malay,To each his bosom-secret say.'Come learn with me the fatal songWhich knits the world in music strong,Come lift thine eyes to lofty rhymes,Of things with things, of times with times,Primal chimes of sun and shade,Of sound and echo, man and maid,The land reflected in the flood,Body with shadow still pursued. For Nature beats in perfect tune,And rounds with rhyme her every rune,Whether she work in land or sea,Or hide underground her alchemy.Thou canst not wave thy staff in air,Or dip thy paddle in the lake,But it carves the bow of beauty there,And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake. The wood is wiser far than thou;The wood and wave each other knowNot unrelated, unaffied,But to each thought and thing allied,Is perfect Nature's every part,Rooted in the mighty Heart.But thou, poor child! unbound, unrhymed,Whence camest thou, misplaced, mistimed,Whence, O thou orphan and defrauded?Is thy land peeled, thy realm marauded?Who thee divorced, deceived and left?Thee of thy faith who hath bereft,And torn the ensigns from thy brow,And sunk the immortal eye so low?Thy cheek too white, thy form too slender,Thy gait too slow, thy habits tenderFor royal man;—they thee confessAn exile from the wilderness,—The hills where health with health agrees,And the wise soul expels disease.Hark! in thy ear I will tell the signBy which thy hurt thou may'st divine.'When thou shalt climb the mountain cliff,Or see the wide shore from thy skiff,To thee the horizon shall expressBut emptiness on emptiness;There lives no man of Nature's worthIn the circle of the earth;And to thine eye the vast skies fall,Dire and satirical,On clucking hens and prating fools,On thieves, on drudges and on dolls.And thou shalt say to the Most High,'Godhead! all this astronomy,And fate and practice and invention,Strong art and beautiful pretension,This radiant pomp of sun and star,Throes that were, and worlds that are,Behold! were in vain and in vain;— It cannot be,—I will look again.Surely now will the curtain rise,And earth's fit tenant me surprise;—But the curtain doth not rise,And Nature has miscarried whollyInto failure, into folly.''Alas! thine is the bankruptcy,Blessed Nature so to see.Come, lay thee in my soothing shade,And heal the hurts which sin has made.I see thee in the crowd alone;I will be thy companion.Quit thy friends as the dead in doom,And build to them a final tomb;Let the starred shade that nightly fallsStill celebrate their funerals,And the bell of beetle and of beeKnell their melodious memory.Behind thee leave thy merchandise,Thy churches and thy charities;And leave thy peacock wit behind;Enough for thee the primal mindThat flows in streams, that breathes in wind:Leave all thy pedant lore apart;God hid the whole world in thy heart.Love shuns the sage, the child it crowns,Gives all to them who all renounce.The rain comes when the wind calls;The river knows the way to the sea;Without a pilot it runs and falls,Blessing all lands with its charity;The sea tosses and foams to findIts way up to the cloud and wind;The shadow sits close to the flying ball;The date fails not on the palm-tree tall;And thou,—go burn thy wormy pages,—Shalt outsee seers, and outwit sages.Oft didst thou thread the woods in vainTo find what bird had piped the strain:—Seek not, and the little eremiteFlies gayly forth and sings in sight.'Hearken once more!I will tell thee the mundane lore.Older am I than thy numbers wot,Change I may, but I pass not.Hitherto all things fast abide,And anchored in the tempest ride.Trenchant time behoves to hurryAll to yean and all to bury:All the forms are fugitive,But the substances survive.Ever fresh the broad creation,A divine improvisation,From the heart of God proceeds,A single will, a million deeds.Once slept the world an egg of stone,And pulse, and sound, and light was none;And God said, 'Throb!' and there was motionAnd the vast mass became vast ocean.Onward and on, the eternal Pan,Who layeth the world's incessant plan,Halteth never in one shape,But forever doth escape,Like wave or flame, into new formsOf gem, and air, of plants, and worms.I, that to-day am a pine,Yesterday was a bundle of grass.He is free and libertine,Pouring of his power the wineTo every age, to every race;.Unto every race and ageHe emptieth the beverage;Unto each, and unto all,Maker and original.The world is the ring of his spells,And the play of his miracles.As he giveth to all to drink,Thus or thus they are and think.With one drop sheds form and feature;With the next a special nature;The third adds heat's indulgent spark;The fourth gives light which eats the dark;Into the fifth himself he flings,And conscious Law is King of kings. As the bee through the garden ranges,From world to world the godhead changes;As the sheep go feeding in the waste,From form to form He maketh haste;This vault which glows immense with lightIs the inn where he lodges for a night.What reeks such Traveller if the bowersWhich bloom and fade like meadow flowersA bunch of fragrant lilies be,Or the stars of eternity?Alike to him the better, the worse,—The glowing angel, the outcast corse.Thou metest him by centuries,And lo! he passes like the breeze;Thou seek'st in globe and galaxy,He hides in pure transparency;Thou askest in fountains and in fires,He is the essence that inquires.He is the axis of the star;He is the sparkle of the spar;He is the heart of every creature;He is the meaning of each feature;And his mind is the sky.Than all it holds more deep, more high.'                                                 Daughter of Heaven and Earth, coy Spring,With sudden passion languishing,Maketh all things softly smile,Painteth pictures mile on mile,Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths,Whence a smokeless incense breathes.Girls are peeling the sweet willow,Poplar white, and Gilead-tree,And troops of boysShouting with whoop and hilloa,And hip, hip three times three.The air is full of whistlings bland;What was that I heardOut of the hazy land?Harp of the wind, or song of bird,Or clapping of shepherd's hands,Or vagrant booming of the air,Voice of a meteor lost in day?Such tidings of the starry sphereCan this elastic air convey.Or haply 't was the cannonadeOf the pent and darkened lake,Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade,Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break,Afflicted moan, and latest holdEven unto May the iceberg cold.Was it a squirrel's pettish bark,Or clarionet of jay? or hark,Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads,Steering north with raucous cryThrough tracts and provinces of sky,Every night alighting downIn new landscapes of romance,Where darkling feed the clamorous clansBy lonely lakes to men unknown.Come the tumult whence it will,Voice of sport, or rush of wings,It is a sound, it is a tokenThat the marble sleep is broken,And a change has passed on things.Beneath the calm, within the light,A hid unruly appetiteOf swifter life, a surer hope,Strains every sense to larger scope,Impatient to anticipateThe halting steps of aged Fate.Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl:When Nature falters, fain would zealGrasp the felloes of her wheel,And grasping give the orbs another whirl.Turn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!And sun this frozen side,Bring hither back the robin's call,Bring back the tulip's pride.Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?The hardy bunting does not chide;The blackbirds make the maples ringWith social cheer and jubilee;The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee,The robins know the melting snow;The sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed,Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves,Secure the osier yet will hideHer callow brood in mantling leaves;And thou, by science all undone,Why only must thy reason failTo see the southing of the sun?As we thaw frozen flesh with snow,So Spring will not, foolish fond,Mix polar night with tropic glow,Nor cloy us with unshaded sun,Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance,But she has the temperanceOf the gods, whereof she is one,--Masks her treasury of heatUnder east-winds crossed with sleet.Plants and birds and humble creaturesWell accept her rule austere;Titan-born, to hardy naturesCold is genial and dear.As Southern wrath to Northern rightIs but straw to anthracite;As in the day of sacrifice,When heroes piled the pyre,The dismal Massachusetts iceBurned more than others' fire,So Spring guards with surface coldThe garnered heat of ages old:Hers to sow the seed of bread,That man and all the kinds be fed;And, when the sunlight fills the hours,Dissolves the crust, displays the flowers.The world rolls round,--mistrust it not,--Befalls again what once befell;All things return, both sphere and mote,And I shall hear my bluebird's note,And dream the dream of Auburn dell.When late I walked, in earlier days,All was stiff and stark;Knee-deep snows choked all the ways,In the sky no spark;Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods,Struggling through the drifted roads;The whited desert knew me not,Snow-ridges masked each darling spot;The summer dells, by genius haunted,One arctic moon had disenchanted.All the sweet secrets therein hidBy Fancy, ghastly spells undid.Eldest mason, Frost, had piled,With wicked ingenuity,Swift cathedrals in the wild;The piny hosts were sheeted ghostsIn the star-lit minster aisled.I found no joy: the icy windMight rule the forest to his mind.Who would freeze in frozen brakes?Back to books and sheltered home,And wood-fire flickering on the walls,To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games,Without the baffled north-wind calls.But soft! a sultry morning breaks;The cowslips make the brown brook gay;A happier hour, a longer day.Now the sun leads in the May,Now desire of action wakes,And the wish to roam.The caged linnet in the SpringHearkens for the choral glee,When his fellows on the wingMigrate from the Southern Sea;When trellised grapes their flowers unmask,And the new-born tendrils twine,The old wine darkling in the caskFeels the bloom on the living vine,And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring:And so, perchance, in Adam's race,Of Eden's bower some dream-like traceSurvived the Flight, and swam the Flood,And wakes the wish in youngest bloodTo tread the forfeit Paradise,And feed once more the exile's eyes;And ever when the happy childIn May beholds the blooming wild,And hears in heaven the bluebird sing,'Onward,' he cries, 'your baskets bring,--In the next field is air more mild,And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier Spring.'Not for a regiment's parade,Nor evil laws or rulers made,Blue Walden rolls its cannonade,But for a lofty signWhich the Zodiac threw,That the bondage-days are told,And waters free as winds shall flow.Lo! how all the tribes combineTo rout the flying foe.See, every patriot oak-leaf throwsHis elfin length upon the snows,Not idle, since the leaf all dayDraws to the spot the solar ray,Ere sunset quarrying inches down,And half-way to the mosses brown;While the grass beneath the rimeHas hints of the propitious time,And upward pries and perforatesThrough the cold slab a thousand gates,Till green lances peering throughBend happy in the welkin blue.April cold with dropping rainWillows and lilacs brings again,The whistle of returning birds,And trumpet-lowing of the herds.The scarlet maple-keys betrayWhat potent blood hath modest May;What fiery force the earth renews,The wealth of forms, the flush of hues;Joy shed in rosy waves abroadFlows from the heart of Love, the Lord.Hither rolls the storm of heat;I feel its finer billows beatLike a sea which me infolds;Heat with viewless fingers moulds,Swells, and mellows, and matures,Paints, and flavours, and allures,Bird and brier inly warms,Still enriches and transforms,Gives the reed and lily length,Adds to oak and oxen strength,Boils the world in tepid lakes,Burns the world, yet burnt remakes;Enveloping heat, enchanted robe,Wraps the daisy and the globe,Transforming what it doth infold,Life out of death, new out of old,Painting fawns' and leopards' fells,Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells,Fires garden with a joyful blazeOf tulips in the morning's rays.The dead log touched bursts into leaf,The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.What god is this imperial Heat,Earth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?Doth it bear hidden in its heartWater-line patterns of all art,All figures, organs, hues, and graces?Is it Daedalus? is it Love?Or walks in mask almighty Jove,And drops from Power's redundant hornAll seeds of beauty to be born?Where shall we keep the holiday,And duly greet the entering May?Too strait and low our cottage doors,And all unmeet our carpet floors;Nor spacious court, nor monarch's hall,Suffice to hold the festival.Up and away! where haughty woodsFront the liberated floods:We will climb the broad-backed hills,Hear the uproar of their joy;We will mark the leaps and gleamsOf the new-delivered streams,And the murmuring rivers of sapMount in the pipes of the trees,Giddy with day, to the topmost spire,Which for a spike of tender greenBartered its powdery cap;And the colours of joy in the bird,And the love in its carol heard,Frog and lizard in holiday coats,And turtle brave in his golden spots;We will hear the tiny roarOf the insects evermore,While cheerful cries of crag and plainReply to the thunder of river and main.As poured the flood of the ancient seaSpilling over mountain chains,Bending forests as bends the sedge,Faster flowing o'er the plains,--A world-wide wave with a foaming edgeThat rims the running silver sheet,--So pours the deluge of the heatBroad northward o'er the land,Painting artless paradises,Drugging herbs with Syrian spices,Fanning secret fires which glowIn columbine and clover-blow,Climbing the northern zones,Where a thousand pallid townsLie like cockles by the main,Or tented armies on a plain.The million-handed sculptor mouldsQuaintest bud and blossom folds,The million-handed painter poursOpal hues and purple dye;Azaleas flush the island floors,And the tints of heaven reply.Wreaths for the May! for happy SpringTo-day shall all her dowry bring,The love of kind, the joy, the grace,Hymen of element and race,Knowing well to celebrateWith song and hue and star and state,With tender light and youthful cheer,The spousals of the new-born year.Lo Love's inundation pouredOver space and race abroad!Spring is strong and virtuous,Broad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous,Quickening underneath the mouldGrains beyond the price of gold.So deep and large her bounties are,That one broad, long midsummer dayShall to the planet overpayThe ravage of a year of war.Drug the cup, thou butler sweet,And send the nectar round;The feet that slid so long on sleetAre glad to feel the ground.Fill and saturate each kindWith good according to its mind,Fill each kind and saturateWith good agreeing with its fate,Willow and violet, maiden and man.The bitter-sweet, the haunting air,Creepeth, bloweth everywhere;It preys on all, all prey on it,Blooms in beauty, thinks in wit,Stings the strong with enterprise,Makes travellers long for Indian skies,And where it comes this courier fleetFans in all hearts expectance sweet,As if to-morrow should redeemThe vanished rose of evening's dream.By houses lies a fresher green,On men and maids a ruddier mien,As if time brought a new relayOf shining virgins every May,And Summer came to ripen maidsTo a beauty that not fades.The ground-pines wash their rusty green,The maple-tops their crimson tint,On the soft path each track is seen,The girl's foot leaves its neater print.The pebble loosened from the frostAsks of the urchin to be tost.In flint and marble beats a heart,The kind Earth takes her children's part,The green lane is the school-boy's friend,Low leaves his quarrel apprehend,The fresh ground loves his top and ball,The air rings jocund to his call,The brimming brook invites a leap,He dives the hollow, climbs the steep.The youth reads omens where he goes,And speaks all languages the rose.The wood-fly mocks with tiny noiseThe far halloo of human voice;The perfumed berry on the spraySmacks of faint memories far away.A subtle chain of countless ringsThe next unto the farthest brings,And, striving to be man, the wormMounts through all the spires of form.I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,Stepping daily onward northTo greet staid ancient cavaliersFiling single in stately train.And who, and who are the travellers?They were Night and Day, and Day and Night,Pilgrims wight with step forthright.I saw the Days deformed and low,Short and bent by cold and snow;The merry Spring threw wreaths on them,Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;Many a flower and many a gem,They were refreshed by the smell,They shook the snow from hats and shoon,They put their April raiment on;And those eternal forms,Unhurt by a thousand storms,Shot up to the height of the sky again,And danced as merrily as young men.I saw them mask their awful glanceSidewise meek in gossamer lids;And to speak my thought if none forbids.It was as if the eternal gods,Tired of their starry periods,Hid their majesty in clothWoven of tulips and painted moth.On carpets green the maskers marchBelow May's well-appointed arch,Each star, each god, each grace amain,Every joy and virtue speed,Marching duly in her train,And fainting Nature at her needIs made whole again.'T was the vintage-day of field and wood,When magic wine for bards is brewed;Every tree and stem and chinkGushed with syrup to the brink.The air stole into the streets of towns,And betrayed the fund of joyTo the high-school and medalled boy:On from hall to chamber ran,From youth to maid, from boy to man,To babes, and to old eyes as well.'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds,Airy turrets purple-piled,Which once my infancy beguiled,Beguile me with the wonted spell.I know ye skilful to convoyThe total freight of hope and joyInto rude and homely nooks,Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books,On farmer's byre, on meadow-pipes,Or on a pool of dancing chips.I care not if the pomps you showBe what they soothfast appear,Or if yon realms in sunset glowBe bubbles of the atmosphere.And if it be to you allowedTo fool me with a shining cloud,So only new griefs are consoledBy new delights, as old by old,Frankly I will be your guest,Count your change and cheer the best.The world hath overmuch of pain,--If Nature give me joy again,Of such deceit I'll not complain.'Ah! well I mind the calendar,Faithful through a thousand years,Of the painted race of flowers,Exact to days, exact to hours,Counted on the spacious dialYon broidered zodiac girds.I know the pretty almanacOf the punctual coming-back,On their due days, of the birds.I marked them yestermorn,A flock of finches dartingBeneath the crystal arch,Piping, as they flew, a march,--Belike the one they used in partingLast year from yon oak or larch;Dusky sparrows in a crowd,Diving, darting northward free,Suddenly betook them all,Every one to his hole in the wall,Or to his niche in the apple-tree.I greet with joy the choral trainsFresh from palms and Cuba's canes.Best gems of Nature's cabinet,With dews of tropic morning wet,Beloved of children, bards, and Spring,O birds, your perfect virtues bring,Your song, your forms, your rhythmic flight,Your manners for the heart's delight,Nestle in hedge, or barn, or roof,Here weave your chamber weather-proof,Forgive our harms, and condescendTo man, as to a lubber friend,And, generous, teach his awkward raceCourage, and probity, and grace!Poets praise that hidden wineHid in milk we drewAt the barrier of Time,When our life was new.We had eaten fairy fruit,We were quick from head to foot,All the forms we look on shoneAs with diamond dews thereon.What cared we for costly joys,The Museum's far-fetched toys?Gleam of sunshine on the wallPoured a deeper cheer than allThe revels of the Carnival.We a pine-grove did preferTo a marble theatre,Could with gods on mallows dine,Nor cared for spices or for wine.Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned,Arch on arch, the grimmest land;Whistle of a woodland birdMade the pulses dance,Note of horn in valleys heardFilled the region with romance.None can tell how sweet,How virtuous, the morning air;Every accent vibrates well;Not alone the wood-bird's call,Or shouting boys that chase their ball,Pass the height of minstrel skill,But the ploughman's thoughtless cry,Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat,And the joiner's hammer-beat,Softened are above their will.All grating discords melt,No dissonant note is dealt,And though thy voice be shrillLike rasping file on steel,Such is the temper of the air,Echo waits with art and care,And will the faults of song repair.So by remote Superior Lake,And by resounding Mackinac,When northern storms and forests shake,And billows on the long beach break,The artful Air doth separateNote by note all sounds that grate,Smothering in her ample breastAll but godlike words,Reporting to the happy earOnly purified accords.Strangely wrought from barking waves,Soft music daunts the Indian braves,--Convent-chanting which the childHears pealing from the panther's caveAnd the impenetrable wild.One musician is sure,His wisdom will not fail,He has not tasted wine impure,Nor bent to passion frail.Age cannot cloud his memory,Nor grief untune his voice,Ranging down the ruled scaleFrom tone of joy to inward wail,Tempering the pitch of allIn his windy cave.He all the fables knows,And in their causes tells,--Knows Nature's rarest moods,Ever on her secret broods.The Muse of men is coy,Oft courted will not come;In palaces and market squaresEntreated, she is dumb;But my minstrel knows and tellsThe counsel of the gods,Knows of Holy Book the spells,Knows the law of Night and Day,And the heart of girl and boy,The tragic and the gay,And what is writ on Table RoundOf Arthur and his peers,What sea and land discoursing sayIn sidereal years.He renders all his loreIn numbers wild as dreams,Modulating all extremes,--What the spangled meadow saithTo the children who have faith;Only to children children sing,Only to youth will spring be spring.Who is the Bard thus magnified?When did he sing, and where abide?Chief of song where poets feastIs the wind-harp which thou seestIn the casement at my side.AEolian harp,How strangely wise thy strain!Gay for youth, gay for youth,(Sweet is art, but sweeter truth,)In the hall at summer eveFate and Beauty skilled to weave.From the eager opening stringsRung loud and bold the song.Who but loved the wind-harp's note?How should not the poet doatOn its mystic tongue,With its primeval memory,Reporting what old minstrels saidOf Merlin locked the harp within,--Merlin paying the pain of sin,Pent in a dungeon made of air,--And some attain his voice to hear,Words of pain and cries of fear,But pillowed all on melody,As fits the griefs of bards to be.And what if that all-echoing shell,Which thus the buried Past can tell,Should rive the Future, and revealWhat his dread folds would fain conceal?It shares the secret of the earth,And of the kinds that owe her birth.Speaks not of self that mystic tone,But of the Overgods alone:It trembles to the cosmic breath,--As it heareth, so it saith;Obeying meek the primal Cause,It is the tongue of mundane laws:And this, at least, I dare affirm,Since genius too has bound and term,There is no bard in all the choir,Not Homer's self, the poet sire,Wise Milton's odes of pensive pleasure,Or Shakspeare, whom no mind can measure,Nor Collins' verse of tender pain,Nor Byron's clarion of disdain,Scott, the delight of generous boys,Or Wordsworth, Pan's recording voice,--Not one of all can put in verse,Or to this presence could rehearse,The sights and voices ravishingThe boy knew on the hills in Spring,When pacing through the oaks he heardSharp queries of the sentry-bird,The heavy grouse's sudden whirr,The rattle of the kingfisher;Saw bonfires of the harlot fliesIn the lowland, when day dies;Or marked, benighted and forlorn,The first far signal-fire of morn.These syllables that Nature spoke,And the thoughts that in him woke,Can adequately utter noneSave to his ear the wind-harp lone.And best can teach its Delphian chordHow Nature to the soul is moored,If once again that silent string,As erst it wont, would thrill and ring.Not long ago, at eventide,It seemed, so listening, at my sideA window rose, and, to say sooth,I looked forth on the fields of youth:I saw fair boys bestriding steeds,I knew their forms in fancy weeds,Long, long concealed by sundering fates,Mates of my youth,--yet not my mates,Stronger and bolder far than I,With grace, with genius, well attired,And then as now from far admired,Followed with loveThey knew not of,With passion cold and shy.O joy, for what recoveries rare!Renewed, I breathe Elysian air,See youth's glad mates in earliest bloom,--Break not my dream, obtrusive tomb!Or teach thou, Spring! the grand recoilOf life resurgent from the soilWherein was dropped the mortal spoil.Soft on the south-wind sleeps the haze!So on thy broad mystic vanLie the opal-coloured days,And waft the miracle to man.Soothsayer of the eldest gods,Repairer of what harms betide,Revealer of the inmost powersPrometheus proffered, Jove denied;Disclosing treasures more than true,Or in what far to-morrow due;Speaking by the tongues of flowers,By the ten-tongued laurel speaking,Singing by the oriole songs,Heart of bird the man's heart seeking;Whispering hints of treasure hidUnder Morn's unlifted lid,Islands looming just beyondThe dim horizon's utmost bound;--Who can, like thee, our rags upbraid,Or taunt us with our hope decayed?Or who like thee persuade,Making the splendour of the air,The morn and sparkling dew, a snare?Or who resentThy genius, wiles, and blandishment?There is no orator prevailsTo beckon or persuadeLike thee the youth or maid:Thy birds, thy songs, thy brooks, thy gales,Thy blooms, thy kinds,Thy echoes in the wilderness,Soothe pain, and age, and love's distress,Fire fainting will, and build heroic minds.For thou, O Spring! canst renovateAll that high God did first create.Be still his arm and architect,Rebuild the ruin, mend defect;Chemist to vamp old worlds with new,Coat sea and sky with heavenlier blue,New-tint the plumage of the birds,And slough decay from grazing herds,Sweep ruins from the scarped mountain,Cleanse the torrent at the fountain,Purge alpine air by towns defiled,Bring to fair mother fairer child,Not less renew the heart and brain,Scatter the sloth, wash out the stain,Make the aged eye sun-clear,To parting soul bring grandeur near.Under gentle types, my SpringMasks the might of Nature's king,An energy that searches thoroughFrom Chaos to the dawning morrow;Into all our human plight,The soul's pilgrimage and flight;In city or in solitude,Step by step, lifts bad to good,Without halting, without rest,Lifting Better up to Best;Planting seeds of knowledge pure,Through earth to ripen, through heaven endure.                                                 Day! hast thou two faces,Making one place two places?One, by humble farmer seen, Chill and wet, unlighted, mean,Useful only, triste and damp,Serving for a laborer's lamp?Have the same mists another side,To be the appanage of pride,Gracing the rich man's wood and lake,His park where amber mornings break,And treacherously bright to showHis planted isle where roses glow?O Day! and is your mightinessA sycophant to smug success?Will the sweet sky and ocean broadBe fine accomplices to fraud?O sun! I curse thy cruel ray!Back, back to chaos, harlot Day!                                                 Ruby wine is drunk by knaves,Sugar spends to fatten slaves,Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;Thunder-clouds are Jove's festoons,Drooping oft in wreaths of dread,Lightning-knotted round his head;The hero is not fed on sweets,Daily his own heart he eats;Chambers of the great are jails,And head-winds right for royal sails.                                                 ALL day the waves assailed the rock,I heard no church-bell chime;The sea-beat scorns the minster clockAnd breaks the glass of Time.                                                 Askest 'How long thou shall stay?'Devastator of the day!Know, each substance and relationThorough nature's operation,Hath its unit, bound, and metre,And every new compoundIs some product and repeater,Product of the early found.But the unit of the visit,The encounter of the wise,Say what other metre is itThan the meeting of the eyes?Nature poureth into natureThrough the channels of that feature.Riding on the ray of Sight,More fleet than waves or whirlwinds go,Or for service or delight,Hearts to hearts their meaning show, Sum their long experience,And import intelligence.Single look has drained the breast,Single moment years confessed.The duration of a glanceIs the term of convenance,And, though thy rede be church or state,Frugal multiples of that.Speeding Saturn cannot halt;Linger,— thou shall rue the fault,If Love his moment overstay,Hatred's swift repulsions play.                                                 Of Merlin wise I learned a song,--Sing it low or sing it loud,It is mightier than the strong,And punishes the proud.I sing it to the surging crowd,--Good men it will calm and cheer,Bad men it will chain and cage.In the heart of the music peals a strainWhich only angels hear;Whether it waken joy or rage,Hushed myriads hark in vain,Yet they who hear it shed their age,And take their youth again.                                                 The lords of life, the lords of life,—- I saw them pass, In their own guise, Like and unlike, Portly and grim, — Use and Surprise, Surface and Dream, Succession swift and spectral Wrong, Temperament without a tongue, And the inventor of the game Omnipresent without name; — Some to see, some to be guessed, They marched from east to west: Little man, least of all, Among the legs of his guardians tall, Walked about with puzzled look. Him by the hand dear Nature took, Dearest Nature, strong and kind, Whispered, 'Darling, never mind! To-morrow they will wear another face, The founder thou; these are thy race!'                                                 IIf thou canst bearStrong meat of simple truthIf thou durst my words compareWith what thou thinkest in my soul’s free youth,Then take this fact unto thy soul,-----God dwells in thee.It is no metaphor nor parable,It is unknown to thousands, and to thee;Yet there is God.IIHe is in thy world,But thy world knows him not.He is the mighty HeartFrom which life’s varied pulses part.Clouded and shrouded there doth sitThe InfiniteEmbosomed in a man;And thou art stranger to thy guestAnd know’st not what thou doth invest.The clouds that veil his life withinAre thy thick woven webs of sin,Which his glory struggling throughDarkens to thine evil hue.IIIThen bear thyself, O man!Up to the scale and compass of thy guest;Soul of thy soul.Be great as doth beseemThe ambassador who bearsThe royal presence where he goes.IVGive up to thy soul-----Let it have its way-----It is, I tell thee, God himself,The selfsame One that rules the Whole,Tho’ he speaks thro’ thee with a stifled voice,And looks through thee, shorn of his beams.But if thou listen to his voice,If thou obey the royal thought,It will grow clearer to thine ear,More glorious to thine eye.The clouds will burst that veil him nowAnd thou shalt see the Lord.VTherefore be great,Not proud,-----too great to be proud.Let not thine eyes rove,Peep not in corners; let thine eyesLook straight before thee, as befitsThe simplicity of Power.And in thy closet carry state;Filled with light, walk therein;And, as a kingWould do no treason to his own empire,So do not thou to thine.VIThis is the reason why thou dost recognizeThings now first revealed,Because in thee residesThe Spirit that lives in all;And thou canst learn the laws of natureBecause its author is latent in thy breast.VIITherefore, O happy youth,Happy if thou dost know and love this truth,Thou art unto thyself a law,And since the soul of things is in thee,Thou needest nothing out of thee.The law, the gospel, and the Providence,Heaven, Hell, the Judgement, and the storesImmeasurable of Truth and Good,All these thou must findWithin thy single mind,Or never find.VIIIThou art the law;The gospel has no revelationOf peace and hope until there is responseFrom the deep chambers of thy mind thereto,-----The rest is straw.It can reveal no truth unknown before.The ProvidenceThou art thyself that doth dispenseWealth to thy work, want to thy sloth,Glory to goodness, to neglect, the moth.Thou sow’st the wind, the whirlwind reapest,Thou payest the wagesOf thy own work, through all ages.The almighty energy withinCrowneth virtue, curseth sin.Virtue sees by its own light;Stumbleth sin in self-made night.IXWho approves thee doing right?God in thee.Who condemns thee doing wrong?God in thee.Who punishes thine evil deed?God in thee.What is thine evil meed?Thy worse mind, with error blindAnd more prone to evilThat is, the greater hiding of the God within:The loss of peaceThe terrible displeasure of this inmateAnd next the consequenceMore faintly as more distant wro’tUpon our outward fortunesWhich decay with viceWith Virtue rise.XThe selfsame GodBy the same lawMakes the souls of angels gladAnd the souls of devils sadSeeThere is nothing else but GodWhere e'er I lookAll things hasten back to himLight is but his shadow dim.XIShall I ask wealth or power of God, who gaveAn image of himself to be my soul?As well might swilling ocean ask a wave,Or the starred firmament a dying coal,-----For that which is in me lives in the whole.                                                 Because I was content with these poor fields,Low open meads, slender and sluggish streams,And found a home in haunts which others scorned,The partial wood-gods overpaid my love,And granted me the freedom of their state,And in their secret senate have prevailedWith the dear dangerous lords that rule our life,Made moon and planets parties to their bond,And pitying through my solitary wontShot million rays of thought and tenderness.For me in showers, in sweeping showers, the springVisits the valley:—break away the clouds,I bathe in the morn's soft and silvered air,And loiter willing by yon loitering stream.Sparrows far off, and, nearer, yonder birdBlue-coated, flying before, from tree to tree,Courageous sing a delicate overture,To lead the tardy concert of the year.Onward, and nearer draws the sun of May,And wide around the marriage of the plantsIs sweetly solemnized; then flows amainThe surge of summer's beauty; dell and crag,Hollow and lake, hill-side, and pine arcade,Are touched with genius. Yonder ragged cliffHas thousand faces in a thousand hours.Here friendly landlords, men ineloquent,Inhabit, and subdue the spacious farms.Traveller! to thee, perchance, a tedious road,Or soon forgotten picture,— to these menThe landscape is an armory of powers,Which, one by one, they know to draw and use.They harness, beast, bird, insect, to their work;They prove the virtues of each bed of rock,And, like a chemist 'mid his loaded jars,Draw from each stratum its adapted use,To drug their crops, or weapon their arts withal. They turn the frost upon their chemic heap;They set the wind to winnow vetch and grain;They thank the spring-flood for its fertile slime;And, on cheap summit-levels of the snow,Slide with the sledge to inaccessible woods,O'er meadows bottomless. So, year by year,They fight the elements with elements,(That one would say, meadow and forest walkedUpright in human shape to rule their like.)And by the order in the field disclose,The order regnant in the yeoman's brain.What these strong masters wrote at large in miles,I followed in small copy in my acre:For there's no rood has not a star above it;The cordial quality of pear or plumAscends as gladly in a single tree,As in broad orchards resonant with bees;And every atom poises for itself,And for the whole. The gentle Mother of allShowed me the lore of colors and of sounds;The innumerable tenements of beauty;The miracle of generative force;Far-reaching concords of astronomyFelt in the plants and in the punctual birds;Mainly, the linked purpose of the whole;And, chiefest prize, found I true liberty,The home of homes plain-dealing Nature gave.The polite found me impolite; the greatWould mortify me, but in vain:I am a willow of the wilderness,Loving the wind that bent me. All my hurtsMy garden-spade can heal. A woodland walk,A wild rose, or rock-loving columbine,Salve my worst wounds, and leave no cicatrice.For thus the wood-gods murmured in my ear,Dost love our manners? Canst thou silent lie?Canst thou, thy pride forgot, like nature passInto the winter night's extinguished mood?Canst thou shine now, then darkle,And being latent, feel thyself no less?As when the all-worshipped moon attracts the eye,The river, hill, stems, foliage, are obscure,Yet envies none, none are unenviable.                                                 I do not count the hours I spendIn wandering by the sea;The forest is my loyal friend,Like God it useth me.In plains that room for shadows makeOf skirting hills to lie,Bound in by streams which give and takeTheir colours from the sky;Or on the mountain-crest sublime,Or down the oaken glade,O what have I to do with time?For this the day was made.Cities of mortals woe begoneFantastic care derides,But in the serious landscape loneStern benefit abides.Sheen will tarnish, honey cloy,And merry is only a mask of sad,But, sober on a fund of joy,The woods at heart are glad.There the great Planter plantsOf fruitful worlds the grain,And with a million spells enchantsThe souls that walk in pain.Still on the seeds of all he madeThe rose of beauty burns;Through times that wear, and forms that fade,Immortal youth returns.The black ducks mounting from the lake,The pigeon in the pines,The bittern's boom, a desert makeWhich no false art refines.Down in yon watery nook,Where bearded mists divide,The gray old gods whom Chaos knew,The sires of Nature, hide.Aloft, in secret veins of air,Blows the sweet breath of song,O, few to scale those uplands dare,Though they to all belong!See thou bring not to field or stoneThe fancies found in books;Leave authors' eyes, and fetch your own,To brave the landscape's looks.And if, amid this dear delight,My thoughts did home rebound,I well might reckon it a slightTo the high cheer I found.Oblivion here thy wisdom is,Thy thrift, the sleep of cares;For a proud idleness like thisCrowns all thy mean affairs.                                                 Thanks to the morning light,Thanks to the seething sea,To the uplands of New Hampshire,To the green-haired forest free;Thanks to each man of courage,To the maids of holy mind,To the boy with his games undaunted,Who never looks behind.Cities of proud hotels,Houses of rich and great,Vice nestles in your chambers,Beneath your roofs of slate.It cannot conquer folly,Time-and-space-conquering steam,—And the light-outspeeding telegraphBears nothing on its beam.The politics are base,The letters do not cheer,And 'tis far in the deeps of history—The voice that speaketh clear.Trade and the streets ensnare us,Our bodies are weak and worn,We plot and corrupt each other,And we despoil the unborn.Yet there in the parlor sitsSome figure of noble guise,Our angel in a stranger's form,Or woman's pleading eyes;Or only a flashing sunbeamIn at the window pane;Or music pours on mortalsIts beautiful disdain.The inevitable morningFinds them who in cellars be,And be sure the all-loving NatureWill smile in a factory.Yon ridge of purple landscape,Yon sky between the walls,Hold all the hidden wondersIn scanty intervals.Alas, the sprite that haunts usDeceives our rash desire,It whispers of the glorious gods,And leaves us in the mire:We cannot learn the cipherThat's writ upon our cell,Stars help us by a mysteryWhich we could never spell.If but one hero knew it,The world would blush in flame,The sage, till he hit the secret,Would hang his head for shame.But our brothers have not read it,Not one has found the key,And henceforth we are comforted,We are but such as they.Still, still the secret presses,The nearing clouds draw down,The crimson morning flames intoThe fopperies of the town.Within, without, the idle earthStars weave eternal rings, The sun himself shines heartily,And shares the joy he brings.And what if trade sow citiesLike shells along the shore,And thatch with towns the prairie broadWith railways ironed o'er;—They are but sailing foambellsAlong Thought's causing stream,And take their shape and Sun-colorFrom him that sends the dream.For destiny does not likeTo yield to men the helm,And shoots his thought by hidden nervesThroughout the solid realm.The patient Dæmon sitsWith roses and a shroud,He has his way, and deals his gifts—But ours is not allowed.He is no churl or trifler,And his viceroy is none,Love-without-weakness,Of genius sire and son; And his will is not thwarted,—The seeds of land and seaAre the atoms of his body bright,And his behest obey.He serveth the servant,The brave he loves amain,He kills the cripple and the sick,And straight begins again;For gods delight in gods,And thrust the weak aside;To him who scorns their charities,Their arms fly open wide.When the old world is sterile,And the ages are effete,He will from wrecks and sedimentThe fairer world complete.He forbids to despair,His cheeks mantle with mirth,And the unimagined good of menIs yeaning at the birth.Spring still makes spring in the mind,When sixty years are told; Love wakes anew this throbbing heart,And we are never old.Over the winter glaciers,I see the summer glow,And through the wild-piled snowdriftThe warm rose buds below.                                                 What care I, so they stand the same,—Things of the heavenly mind,—How long the power to give them fameTarries yet behind?Thus far to-day your favors reach,O fair, appeasing Presences!Ye taught my lips a single speech,And a thousand silences.Space grants beyond his fated roadNo inch to the god of day,And copious language still bestowedOne word, no more, to say.                                                 The living Heaven thy prayers respect,House at once and architect,Quarrying man's rejected hours,Builds therewith eternal towers;Sole and self-commanded works,Fears not undermining days,Grows by decays,And, by the famous might that lurksIn reaction and recoil,Makes flame to freeze and ice to boil;Forging, through swart arms of Offence,The silver seat of Innocence.                                                 Space is ample, east and west,But two cannot go abreast,Cannot travel in it two:Yonder masterful cuckooCrowds every egg out of the nest,Quick or dead, except its own;A spell is laid on sod and stone,Night and day were tampered with,Every quality and pithSurcharged and sultry with a powerThat works its will on age and hour.                                                 Thousand minstrels woke within me,"Our music's in the hills; "—Gayest pictures rose to win me,Leopard-colored rills.Up!—If thou knew'st who callsTo twilight parks of beech and pine,High over the river intervals,Above the ploughman's highest line,Over the owner's farthest walls;—Up!—where the airy citadelO'erlooks the purging landscape's swell.Let not unto the stones the dayHer lily and rose, her sea and land display;Read the celestial sign!Lo! the South answers to the North;Bookworm, break this sloth urbane;A greater Spirit bids thee forth,Than the gray dreams which thee detain.Mark how the climbing OreadsBeckon thee to their arcades;Youth, for a moment free as they,Teach thy feet to feel the ground,Ere yet arrive the wintry dayWhen Time thy feet has bound.Accept the bounty of thy birth;Taste the lordship of the earth.I heard and I obeyed,Assured that he who pressed the claim,Well-known, but loving not a name,Was not to be gainsaid.Ere yet the summoning voice was still,I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill.From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowedLike ample banner flung abroadRound about, a hundred miles,With invitation to the sea, and to the bordering isles.In his own loom's garment drest,By his own bounty blest,Fast abides this constant giver,Pouring many a cheerful river;To far eyes, an aërial isle,Unploughed, which finer spirits pile,Which morn and crimson evening paintFor bard, for lover, and for saint;The country's core,Inspirer, prophet evermore,Pillar which God aloft had setSo that men might it not forget,It should be their life's ornament,And mix itself with each event;Their calendar and dial,Barometer, and chemic phial,Garden of berries, perch of birds,Pasture of pool-haunting herds,Graced by each change of sum untold,Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving cold.The Titan minds his sky-affairs,Rich rents and wide alliance shares;Mysteries of color daily laidBy the great sun in light and shade,And, sweet varieties of chance,And the mystic seasons' dance,And thief-like step of liberal hoursWhich thawed the snow-drift into flowers.O wondrous craft of plant and stoneBy eldest science done and shown!Happy, I said, whose home is here,Fair fortunes to the mountaineer!Boon nature to his poorest shedHas royal pleasure-grounds outspread.Intent I searched the region round,And in low hut my monarch found.He was no eagle and no earl,Alas! my foundling was a churl,With heart of cat, and eyes of bug,Dull victim of his pipe and mug;Woe is me for my hopes' downfall!Lord! is yon squalid peasant allThat this proud nursery could breedFor God's vicegerency and stead?Time out of mind this forge of ores,Quarry of spars in mountain pores,Old cradle, hunting ground, and bierOf wolf and otter, bear, and deer;Well-built abode of many a race;Tower of observance searching space;Factory of river, and of rain;Link in the alps' globe-girding chain;By million changes skilled to tellWhat in the Eternal standeth well,And what obedient nature can,—Is this colossal talismanKindly to creature, blood, and kind,And speechless to the master's mind?I thought to find the patriotsIn whom the stock of freedom roots.To myself I oft recountTales of many a famous mount.—Wales, Scotland, Uri, Hungary's dells,Roys, and Scanderbegs, and Tells.Here now shall nature crowd her powers,Her music, and her meteors,And, lifting man to the blue deepWhere stars their perfect courses keep,Like wise preceptor lure his eyeTo sound the science of the sky,And carry learning to its heightOf untried power and sane delight;The Indian cheer, the frosty skiesBreed purer wits, inventive eyes,Eyes that frame cities where none be,And hands that stablish what these see:And, by the moral of his place,Hint summits of heroic grace;Man in these crags a fastness findTo fight pollution of the mind;In the wide thaw and ooze of wrong,Adhere like this foundation strong,The insanity of towns to stemWith simpleness for stratagem.But if the brave old mould is broke,And end in clowns the mountain-folk,In tavern cheer and tavern joke,—Sink, O mountain! in the swamp,Hide in thy skies, O sovereign lap!Perish like leaves the highland breed!No sire survive, no son succeed!Soft! let not the offended museToil's hard hap with scorn accuse.Many hamlets sought I then,Many farms of mountain men;—Found I not a minstrel seed,But men of bone, and good at need.Rallying round a parish steepleNestle warm the highland people,Coarse and boisterous, yet mild,Strong as giant, slow as child,Smoking in a squalid room,Where yet the westland breezes come.Close hid in those rough guises lurkWestern magians, here they work;Sweat and season are their arts,Their talismans are ploughs and carts;And well the youngest can commandHoney from the frozen land,With sweet hay the swamp adorn,Change the running sand to corn,For wolves and foxes, lowing herds,And for cold mosses, cream and curds;Weave wood to canisters and mats,Drain sweet maple-juice in vats.No bird is safe that cuts the air,From their rifle or their snare;No fish in river or in lake,But their long hands it thence will take;And the country's iron faceLike wax their fashioning skill betrays,To fill the hollows, sink the hills,Bridge gulfs, drain swamps, build dams and mills,And fit the bleak and howling placeFor gardens of a finer race,The world-soul knows his own affair,Fore-looking when his hands prepareFor the next ages men of mould,Well embodied, well ensouled,He cools the present's fiery glow,Sets the life pulse strong, but slow.Bitter winds and fasts austere.His quarantines and grottos, whereHe slowly cures decrepit flesh,And brings it infantile and fresh.These exercises are the toysAnd games with which he breathes his boys.They bide their time, and well can prove,If need were, their line from Jove,Of the same stuff, and so allayed,As that whereof the sun is made;And of that fibre quick and strongWhose throbs are love, whose thrills are song. Now in sordid weeds they sleep,Their secret now in dulness keep.Yet, will you learn our ancient speech,These the masters who can teach,Fourscore or a hundred wordsAll their vocal muse affords,These they turn in other fashionThan the writer or the parson.I can spare the college-bell,And the learned lecture well.Spare the clergy and libraries,Institutes and dictionaries,For the hardy English rootThrives here unvalued underfoot.Rude poets of the tavern hearth,Squandering your unquoted mirth,Which keeps the ground and never soars,While Jake retorts and Reuben roars,Tough and screaming as birch-bark,Goes like bullet to its mark,While the solid curse and jeerNever balk the waiting ear:To student ears keen-relished jokesOn truck, and stock, and farming-folks,—Nought the mountain yields thereofBut savage health and sinews tough.On the summit as I stood,O'er the wide floor of plain and flood,Seemed to me the towering hillWas not altogether still,But a quiet sense conveyed;If I err not, thus it said:Many feet in summer seekBetimes my far-appearing peak;In the dreaded winter-time,None save dappling shadows climbUnder clouds my lonely head,Old as the sun, old almost as the shade.And comest thouTo see strange forests and new snow,And tread uplifted land?And leavest thou thy lowland race,Here amid clouds to stand,And would'st be my companion,Where I gazeAnd shall gazeWhen forests fall, and man is gone,Over tribes and over timesAs the burning LyreNearing me,With its stars of northern fire,In many a thousand years.Ah! welcome, if thou bringMy secret in thy brain;To mountain-top may muse's wingWith good allowance strain.Gentle pilgrim, if thou knowThe gamut old of Pan,And how the hills began,The frank blessings of the hillFall on thee, as fall they will.'Tis the law of bush and stone—Each can only take his own.Let him heed who can and will,—Enchantment fixed me hereTo stand the hurts of time, untilIn mightier chant I disappear.If thou trowestHow the chemic eddies playPole to pole, and what they say,And that these gray cragsNot on crags are hung,But beads are of a rosaryOn prayer and music strung;And, credulous, through the granite seemingSeest the smile of Reason beaming;Can thy style-discerning eyeThe hidden-working Builder spy,Who builds, yet makes no chips, no din,With hammer soft as snow-flake's flight;Knowest thou this?O pilgrim, wandering not amiss!Already my rocks lie light,And soon my cone will spin.For the world was built in order,And the atoms march in tune,Rhyme the pipe, and time the warder,Cannot forget the sun, the moon.Orb and atom forth they prance,When they hear from far the rune,None so backward in the troop,When the music and the danceReach his place and circumstance,But knows the sun-creating sound,And, though a pyramid, will bound.Monadnoc is a mountain strong,Tall and good my kind among,But well I know, no mountain canMeasure with a perfect man;For it is on Zodiack's writ,Adamant is soft to wit;And when the greater comes again,With my music in his brain,I shall pass as glides my shadowDaily over hill and meadow.Through all timeI hear the approaching feetAlong the flinty pathway beatOf him that cometh, and shall come,—Of him who shall as lightly bearMy daily load of woods and streams,As now the round sky-cleaving boatWhich never strains its rocky beams,Whose timbers, as they silent float,Alps and Caucasus uprear,And the long Alleghanies here,And all town-sprinkled lands that be,Sailing through stars with all their history.Every morn I lift my head,Gaze o'er New England underspreadSouth from Saint Lawrence to the Sound,From Katshill east to the sea-bound.Anchored fast for many an age,I await the bard and sage,Who in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed,Shall string Monadnoc like a bead.Comes that cheerful troubadour,This mound shall throb his face before,As when with inward fires and painIt rose a bubble from the plain.When he cometh, I shall shedFrom this well-spring in my headFountain drop of spicier worthThan all vintage of the earth.There's fruit upon my barren soilCostlier far than wine or oil;There's a berry blue and gold,—Autumn-ripe its juices hold,Sparta's stoutness, Bethlehem's heart,Asia's rancor, Athens' art,Slowsure Britain's secular might,And the German's inward sight;I will give my son to eatBest of Pan's immortal meat,Bread to eat and juice to drink,So the thoughts that he shall thinkShall not be forms of stars, but stars,Nor pictures pale, but Jove and Mars.He comes, but not of that race bredWho daily climb my specular head.Oft as morning wreathes my scarf,Fled the last plumule of the dark,Pants up hither the spruce clerkFrom South-Cove and City-wharf;I take him up my rugged sides,Half-repentant, scant of breath,—Bead-eyes my granite chaos show,And my midsummer snow;Open the daunting map beneath,—All his county, sea and land,Dwarfed to measure of his hand;His day's ride is a furlong space,His city tops a glimmering haze:I plant his eyes on the sky-hoop bounding;—See there the grim gray roundingOf the bullet of the earthWhereon ye sail,Tumbling steepIn the uncontinented deep;—He looks on that, and he turns pale:'Tis even so, this treacherous kite,Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere,Thoughtless of its anxious freight,Plunges eyeless on for ever,And he, poor parasite,—Cooped in a ship he cannot steer,Who is the captain he knows not,Port or pilot trows not,—Risk or ruin he must share.I scowl on him with my cloud,With my north wind chill his blood,I lame him clattering down the rocks,And to live he is in fear.Then, at last, I let him downOnce more into his dapper town,To chatter frightened to his clan,And forget me, if he can.As in the old poetic fameThe gods are blind and lame,And the simular despiteBetrays the more abounding might,So call not waste that barren coneAbove the floral zone,Where forests starve:It is pure use;What sheaves like those which here we glean and bind,Of a celestial Ceres, and the Muse?Ages are thy days,Thou grand expressor of the present tense,And type of permanence,Firm ensign of the fatal Being,Amid these coward shapes of joy and griefThat will not bide the seeing.Hither we bringOur insect miseries to the rocks,And the whole flight with pestering wingVanish and end their murmuring,Vanish beside these dedicated blocks,Which, who can tell what mason laid?Spoils of a front none need restore,Replacing frieze and architrave;Yet flowers each stone rosette and metope brave,Still is the haughty pile erectOf the old building Intellect.Complement of human kind,Having us at vantage still,Our sumptuous indigence,O barren mound! thy plenties fill.We fool and prate,—Thou art silent and sedate.To million kinds and times one senseThe constant mountain doth dispense,Shedding on all its snows and leaves,One joy it joys, one grief it grieves.Thou seest, O watchman tall!Our towns and races grow and fall,And imagest the stable GoodFor which we all our lifetime grope,In shifting form the formless mind;And though the substance us elude,We in thee the shadow find.Thou in our astronomyAn opaker star,Seen, haply, from afar,Above the horizon's hoop.A moment by the railway troop,As o'er some bolder height they speed,—By circumspect ambition,By errant Gain,By feasters, and the frivolous,—Recallest us,And makest sane.Mute orator! well-skilled to plead,And send conviction without phrase,Thou dost supplyThe shortness of our days,And promise, on thy Founder's truth,Long morrow to this mortal youth.                                                 Though loth to grieveThe evil time's sole patriot,I cannot leaveMy buried thoughtFor the priest's cant,Or statesman's rant.If I refuseMy study for their politique,Which at the best is trick,The angry musePuts confusion in my brain.But who is he that pratesOf the culture of mankind,Of better arts and life?Go, blind worm, go,Behold the famous StatesHarrying MexicoWith rifle and with knife.Or who, with accent bolder,Dare praise the freedom-loving mountaineer,I found by thee, O rushing Contoocook!And in thy valleys, Agiochook!The jackals of the negro-holder.The God who made New HampshireTaunted the lofty landWith little men.Small bat and wrenHouse in the oak.If earth fire cleaveThe upheaved land, and bury the folk,The southern crocodile would grieve.Virtue palters, right is hence,Freedom praised but hid;Funeral eloquenceRattles the coffin-lid.What boots thy zeal,O glowing friend,That would indignant rendThe northland from the south?Wherefore? To what good end?Boston Bay and Bunker HillWould serve things still:Things are of the snake.The horseman serves the horse,The neat-herd serves the neat,The merchant serves the purse,The eater serves his meat;'Tis the day of the chattel,Web to weave, and corn to grind,Things are in the saddle,And ride mankind.There are two laws discreteNot reconciled,Law for man, and law for thing;The last builds town and fleet,But it runs wild,And doth the man unking.'Tis fit the forest fall,The steep be graded,The mountain tunnelled,The land shaded,The orchard planted,The globe tilled,The prairie planted,The steamer built.Live for friendship, live for love,For truth's and harmony's behoof;The state may follow how it can,As Olympus follows Jove.Yet do not I imploreThe wrinkled shopman to my sounding woods,Nor bid the unwilling senatorAsk votes of thrushes in the solitudes.Every one to his chosen work.Foolish hands may mix and mar,Wise and sure the issues are.Round they roll, till dark is light,Sex to sex, and even to odd;The over-God,Who marries Right to Might,Who peoples, unpeoples,He who exterminatesRaces by stronger races,Black by white faces,Knows to bring honeyOut of the lion,Grafts gentlest scionOn Pirate and Turk.The Cossack eats Poland,Like stolen fruit;Her last noble is ruined,Her last poet mute;Straight into double bandThe victors divide,Half for freedom strike and stand,The astonished muse finds thousands at her side.                                                 The rain has spoiled the farmer's day;Shall sorrow put my books away?Thereby are two days lost:Nature shall mind her own affairs,I will attend my proper cares,In rain, or sun, or frost.                                                 And I behold once moreMy old familiar haunts; here the blue river,The same blue wonder that my infant eyeAdmired, sage doubting whence the traveller came,--Whence brought his sunny bubbles ere he washedThe fragrant flag-roots in my father's fields,And where thereafter in the world he went.Look, here he is, unaltered, save that nowHe hath broke his banks and flooded all the valesWith his redundant waves.Here is the rock where, yet a simple child,I caught with bended pin my earliest fish,Much triumphing,--and these the fieldsOver whose flowers I chased the butterfly,A blooming hunter of a fairy fine.And hark! where overhead the ancient crowsHold their sour conversation in the sky:--These are the same, but I am not the same,But wiser than I was, and wise enoughNot to regret the changes, tho' they costMe many a sigh. Oh, call not Nature dumb;These trees and stones are audible to me,These idle flowers, that tremble in the wind,I understand their faery syllables,And all their sad significance. The wind,That rustles down the well-known forest road--It hath a sound more eloquent than speech.The stream, the trees, the grass, the sighing wind,All of them utter sounds of 'monishmentAnd grave parental love.They are not of our race, they seem to say,And yet have knowledge of our moral race,And somewhat of majestic sympathy,Something of pity for the puny clay,That holds and boasts the immeasurable mind.I feel as I were welcome to these treesAfter long months of weary wandering,Acknowledged by their hospitable boughs;They know me as their son, for side by side,They were coeval with my ancestors,Adorned with them my country's primitive times,And soon may give my dust their funeral shade.                                                 Once I wished I might rehearseFreedom's paean in my verse,That the slave who caught the strainShould throb until he snapped his chain.But the Spirit said, 'Not so;Speak it not, or speak it low;Name not lightly to be said,Gift too precious to be prayed,Passion not to be expressedBut by heaving of the breast:Yet,--wouldst thou the mountain findWhere this deity is shrined,Who gives to seas and sunset skiesTheir unspent beauty of surprise,And, when it lists him, waken canBrute or savage into man;Or, if in thy heart he shine,Blends the starry fates with thine,Draws angels nigh to dwell with thee,And makes thy thoughts archangels be;Freedom's secret wilt thou know?--Counsel not with flesh and blood;Loiter not for cloak or food;Right thou feelest, rush to do.'                                                 The word of the Lord by nightTo the watching Pilgrims came,As they sat by the seaside,And filled their hearts with flame.God said, I am tired of kings,I suffer them no more;Up to my ear the morning bringsThe outrage of the poor.Think ye I made this ballA field of havoc and war,Where tyrants great and tyrants smallMight harry the weak and poor?My angel, his name is Freedom,--Choose him to be your king;He shall cut pathways east and west,And fend you with his wing.Lo! I uncover the landWhich I hid of old time in the West,As the sculptor uncovers the statueWhen he has wrought his best;I show Columbia, of the rocksWhich dip their foot in the seas,And soar to the air-borne flocksOf clouds, and the boreal fleece.I will divide my goods;Call in the wretch and slave:None shall rule but the humble,And none but Toil shall have.I will have never a noble,No lineage counted great;Fishers and choppers and ploughmenShall constitute a state.Go, cut down trees in the forest,And trim the straightest boughs;Cut down the trees in the forest,And build me a wooden house.Call the people together,The young men and the sires,The digger in the harvest field,Hireling, and him that hires;And here in a pine state-houseThey shall choose men to ruleIn every needful faculty,In church, and state, and school.Lo, now! if these poor menCan govern the land and sea,And make just laws below the sun,As planets faithful be.And ye shall succour men;'T is nobleness to serve;Help them who cannot help again:Beware from right to swerve.I break your bonds and masterships,And I unchain the slave:Free be his heart and hand henceforthAs wind and wandering wave.I cause from every creatureHis proper good to flow:As much as he is and doeth,So much he shall bestow.But laying hands on anotherTo coin his labour and sweat,He goes in pawn to his victimFor eternal years in debt.To-day unbind the captive,So only are ye unbound;Lift up a people from the dust,Trump of their rescue, sound!Pay ransom to the owner,And fill the bag to the brim.Who is the owner? The slave is owner,And ever was. Pay him.O North! give him beauty for rags,And honour, O South! for his shame;Nevada! coin thy golden cragsWith Freedom's image and name.Up! and the dusky raceThat sat in darkness long,--Be swift their feet as antelopes,And as behemoth strong.Come, East and West and North,By races, as snow-flakes,And carry my purpose forth,Which neither halts nor shakes.My will fulfilled shall be,For, in daylight or in dark,My thunderbolt has eyes to seeHis way home to the mark.                                                 Thy summer voice, Musketaquit, Repeats the music of the rain; But sweeter rivers pulsing flit Through thee, as thou through the Concord Plain. Thou in thy narrow banks art pent: The stream I love unbounded goes Through flood and sea and firmament; Through light, through life, it forward flows. I see the inundation sweet, I hear the spending of the steam Through years, through men, through Nature fleet, Through love and thought, through power and dream. Musketaquit, a goblin strong, Of shard and flint makes jewels gay; They lose their grief who hear his song, And where he winds is the day of day. So forth and brighter fares my stream,—Who drink it shall not thirst again; No darkness taints its equal gleam, And ages drop in it like rain.                                                 Two well-assorted travellers useThe highway, Eros and the Muse.From the twins is nothing hidden,To the pair is naught forbidden;Hand in hand the comrades goEvery nook of nature through:Each for other they were born,Each can other best adorn;They know one only mortal griefPast all balsam or relief,When, by false companions crossed,The pilgrims have each other lost.                                                 I cannot spare water or wine,Tobacco-leaf, or poppy, or rose;From the earth-poles to the Line,All between that works or grows,Every thing is kin of mine.Give me agates for my meat,Give me cantharids to eat,From air and ocean bring me foods,From all zones and altitudes.From all natures, sharp and slimy,Salt and basalt, wild and tame,Tree, and lichen, ape, sea-lion,Bird and reptile be my game.Ivy for my fillet band,Blinding dogwood in my hand,Hemlock for my sherbet cull me,And the prussic juice to lull me,Swing me in the upas boughs,Vampire-fanned, when I carouse.Too long shut in strait and few,Thinly dieted on dew,I will use the world, and sift it,To a thousand humors shift it,As you spin a cherry.O doleful ghosts, and goblins merry,O all you virtues, methods, mights;Means, appliances, delights;Reputed wrongs, and braggart rights;Smug routine, and things allowed;Minorities, things under cloud!Hither! take me, use me, fill me,Vein and artery, though ye kill me;God! I will not be an owl,But sun me in the Capitol.                                                 What boots it, thy virtue,What profit thy parts,While one thing thou lackest,The art of all arts!The only credentials,Passport to success,Opens castle and parlor,—Address, man, Address.The maiden in dangerWas saved by the swain,His stout arm restored herTo Broadway again:The maid would reward him,—Gay company come,—They laugh, she laughs with them,He is moonstruck and dumb.This clenches the bargain,Sails out of the bay,Gets the vote in the Senate,Spite of Webster and Clay;Has for genius no mercy,For speeches no heed,—It lurks in the eyebeam,It leaps to its deed.Church, tavern, and market,Bed and board it will sway;It has no to-morrow,It ends with to-day.                                                 Sicut Patribus, sit Deus Nobis)The rocky nook with hilltops three Looked eastward from the farms, And twice each day the flowing sea Took Boston in its arms; The men of yore were stout and poor, And sailed for bread to every shore. And where they went on trade intent They did what freeman can, Their dauntless ways did all men praise, The merchant was a man. The world was made for honest trade,- To plant and eat be none afraid. The waves that rocked them on the deep To them their secret told; Said the winds that sung the lads to sleep, 'Like us be free and bold!' The honest waves refuse to slaves The empire of the ocean caves. Old Europe groans with palaces, Has lords enough and more;- We plant and build by foaming seas A city of the poor;- For day by day could Boston Bay Their honest labor overpay. We grant no dukedoms to the few, We hold like rights and shall;- Equal on Sunday in the pew, On Monday in the mall. For what avail the plough or sail, Or land or life, if freedom fail? The noble craftsmen we promote, Disown the knave and fool; Each honest man shall have his vote, Each child shall have his school. A union then of honest men, Or union nevermore again. The wild rose and the barberry thorn Hung out their summer pride Where now on heated pavements worn The feet of millions stride. Fair rose the planted hills behind The good town on the bay, And where the western hills declined The prairie stretched away. What care though rival cities soar Along the stormy coast: Penn's town, New York, and Baltimore, If Boston knew the most! They laughed to know the world so wide; The mountains said: 'Good-day! We greet you well, you Saxon men, Up with your towns and stay!' The world was made for honest trade,- To plant and eat be none afraid. 'For you,' they said, 'no barriers be, For you no sluggard rest; Each street leads downward to the sea, Or landward to the West.' O happy town beside the sea, Whose roads lead everywhere to all; Than thine no deeper moat can be, No stouter fence, no steeper wall! Bad news from George on the English throne: 'You are thriving well,' said he; 'Now by these presents be it known, You shall pay us a tax on tea; 'Tis very small,-no load at all,- Honor enough that we send the call.' 'Not so,' said Boston, 'good my lord, We pay your governors here Abundant for their bed and board, Six thousand pounds a year. (Your highness knows our homely word,) Millions for self-government, But for tribute never a cent.' The cargo came! and who could blame If Indians seized the tea, And, chest by chest, let down the same Into the laughing sea? For what avail the plough or sail Or land or life, if freedom fail? The townsmen braved the English king, Found friendship in the French, And Honor joined the patriot ring Low on their wooden bench. O bounteous seas that never fail! O day remembered yet! O happy port that spied the sail Which wafted Lafayette! Pole-star of light in Europe's night, That never faltered from the right. Kings shook with fear, old empires crave The secret force to find Which fired the little State to save The rights of all mankind. But right is might through all the world; Province to province faithful clung, Through good and ill the war-bolt hurled, Till Freedom cheered and the joy-bells rung. The sea returning day by day Restores the world-wide mart; So let each dweller on the Bay Fold Boston in his heart, Till these echoes be choked with snows, Or over the town blue ocean flows.                                                 Set not thy foot on graves;Hear what wine and roses say;The mountain chase, the summer waves,The crowded town, thy feet may well delay.Set not thy foot on graves;Nor seek to unwind the shroudWhich charitable timeAnd nature have allowedTo wrap the errors of a sage sublime.Set not thy foot on graves;Care not to strip the deadOf his sad ornament;His myrrh, and wine, and rings,His sheet of lead,And trophies buried;Go get them where he earned them when alive,As resolutely dig or dive.Life is too short to wasteThe critic bite or cynic bark,Quarrel, or reprimand;'Twill soon be dark;Up! mind thine own aim, andGod speed the mark.                                                 Long I followed happy guides,—I could never reach their sides.Their step is forth, and, ere the day,Breaks up their leaguer, and away.Keen my sense, my heart was young,Right goodwill my sinews strung,But no speed of mine availsTo hunt upon their shining trails.On and away, their hasting feetMake the morning proud and sweet.Flowers they strew, I catch the scent,Or tone of silver instrumentLeaves on the wind melodious trace,Yet I could never see their face.On eastern hills I see their smokesMixed with mist by distant lochs.I meet many travellersWho the road had surely kept,—They saw not my fine revellers,—These had crossed them while they slept.Some had heard their fair reportIn the country or the court.Fleetest couriers aliveNever yet could once arrive,As they went or they returned,At the house where these sojourned.Sometimes their strong speed they slacken,Though they are not overtaken:In sleep, their jubilant troop is near,I tuneful voices overhear,It may be in wood or waste,—At unawares 'tis come and passed.Their near camp my spirit knowsBy signs gracious as rainbows.I thenceforward and long afterListen for their harplike laughter,And carry in my heart for daysPeace that hallows rudest ways.—                                                 Burly dozing humblebee!Where thou art is clime for me.Let them sail for Porto Rique,Far-off heats through seas to seek,I will follow thee alone,Thou animated torrid zone!Zig-zag steerer, desert-cheerer,Let me chase thy waving lines,Keep me nearer, me thy hearer,Singing over shrubs and vines.Insect lover of the sun,Joy of thy dominion!Sailor of the atmosphere,Swimmer through the waves of air,Voyager of light and noon,Epicurean of June,Wait I prithee, till I comeWithin ear-shot of thy hum,—All without is martyrdom.When the south wind, in May days,With a net of shining haze,Silvers the horizon wall,And, with softness touching all,Tints the human countenanceWith a color of romance,And, infusing subtle heats,Turns the sod to violets,Thou in sunny solitudes,Rover of the underwoods,The green silence dost displace,With thy mellow breezy bass.Hot midsummer's petted crone,Sweet to me thy drowsy tune,Telling of countless sunny hours,Long days, and solid banks of flowers,Of gulfs of sweetness without boundIn Indian wildernesses found,Of Syrian peace, immortal leisure,Firmest cheer and bird-like pleasure.Aught unsavory or unclean,Hath my insect never seen, But violets and bilberry bells,Maple sap and daffodels,Grass with green flag half-mast high,Succory to match the sky,Columbine with horn of honey,Scented fern, and agrimony,Clover, catch fly, adders-tongue,And brier-roses dwelt among;All beside was unknown waste,All was picture as he passed.Wiser far than human seer,Yellow-breeched philosopher!Seeing only what is fair,Sipping only what is sweet,Thou dost mock at fate and care,Leave the chaff and take the wheat,When the fierce north-western blastCools sea and land so far and fast,Thou already slumberest deep,—Woe and want thou canst out-sleep,—Want and woe which torture us,Thy sleep makes ridiculous.                                                 OUR eyeless bark sails free,Though with boom and sparAndes, Alp, or HimmaleeStrikes never moon or star.                                                 Seek not the Spirit, if it hide,Inexorable to thy zeal:Baby, do not whine and chide;Art thou not also real?Why should'st thou stoop to poor excuse?Turn on the Accuser roundly; say,"Here am I, here will I remainForever to myself soothfast,Go thou, sweet Heaven, or, at thy pleasure stay."—Already Heaven with thee its lot has cast,For it only can absolutely deal.                                                 The sun goes down, and with him takes The coarseness of my por attire; The fair moon mounts, and aye the flame Of Gypsy beauty blazes higher.Pale Northern girls! you scorn our race; You captives of your air-tight halls, Wear out in-doors your sickly days, But leave us the horizon walls.And if I take you, dames, to task, And say it frankly without guile, Then you are Gypsies in a mask, And I the lady all the while.If, on the heath, below the moon, I court and play with paler blood, Me false to mine dare whisper none,-- One sallow horseman knows me good.Go, keep your cheek's rose from the rain, For teeth and hair with shopmen deal; My swarthy tint is in the grain, The rocks and forest knoww it real.The wild air bloweth in out lungs, The keen stars twinkle in our eyes, The birds gave us our wily tongues, The panther in our dances flies.You doubt we read the stars on high, Nathless we read your fortunes true; The stars may hide in the upper sky, But without glass we fathom you.                                                 IT fell in the ancient periods   Which the brooding soul surveys,Or ever the wild Time coin'd itself   Into calendar months and days. This was the lapse of Uriel,Which in Paradise befell.Once, among the Pleiads walking,Sayd overheard the young gods talking; And the treason, too long pent,To his ears was evident.The young deities discuss'dLaws of form, and metre just,Orb, quintessence, and sunbeams,What subsisteth, and what seems.One, with low tones that decide,And doubt and reverend use defied,With a look that solved the sphere,And stirr'd the devils everywhere,Gave his sentiment divineAgainst the being of a line.'Line in nature is not found; Unit and universe are round; In vain produced, all rays return; Evil will bless, and ice will burn.'As Uriel spoke with piercing eye,A shudder ran around the sky; The stern old war-gods shook their heads; The seraphs frown'd from myrtle-beds; Seem'd to the holy festivalThe rash word boded ill to all; The balance-beam of Fate was bent; The bounds of good and ill were rent; Strong Hades could not keep his own,But all slid to confusion.A sad self-knowledge withering fellOn the beauty of Uriel; In heaven once eminent, the godWithdrew that hour into his cloud; Whether doom'd to long gyrationIn the sea of generation,Or by knowledge grown too brightTo hit the nerve of feebler sight.Straightway a forgetting windStole over the celestial kind,And their lips the secret kept,If in ashes the fire-seed slept.But, now and then, truth-speaking thingsShamed the angels' veiling wings; And, shrilling from the solar course,Or from fruit of chemic force,Procession of a soul in matter,Or the speeding change of water,Or out of the good of evil born,Came Uriel's voice of cherub scorn,And a blush tinged the upper sky,And the gods shook, they knew not why                                                 When I was born,From all the seas of strength Fate filled a chalice,Saying, This be thy portion, child; this chalice,Less than a lily's, thou shalt daily drawFrom my great arteries; nor less, nor more.All substances the cunning chemist TimeMelts down into that liquor of my life,Friends, foes, joys, fortunes, beauty, and disgust,And whether I am angry or content,Indebted or insulted, loved or hurt,All he distils into sidereal wine,And brims my little cup; heedless, alas!Of all he sheds how little it will hold,How much runs over on the desert sands.If a new muse draw me with splendid ray,And I uplift myself into her heaven,The needs of the first sight absorb my blood,And all the following hours of the dayDrag a ridiculous age.To-day, when friends approach, and every hourBrings book or starbright scroll of genius,The tiny cup will hold not a bead more,And all the costly liquor runs to waste,Nor gives the jealous time one diamond dropSo to be husbanded for poorer days.Why need I volumes, if one word suffice?Why need I galleries, when a pupil's draughtAfter the master's sketch, fills and o'erfillsMy apprehension? Why should I roam,Who cannot circumnavigate the seaOf thoughts and things at home, but still adjournThe nearest matters to another moon?Why see new menWho have not understood the old?                                                 The green grass is growing,The morning wind is in it,'Tis a tune worth the knowing,Though it change every minute.'Tis a tune of the spring,Every year plays it over,To the robin on the wing,To the pausing lover.O'er ten thousand thousand acresGoes light the nimble zephyr,The flowers, tiny feet of shakers,Worship him ever.Hark to the winning sound!They summon thee, dearest,Saying; "We have drest for thee the ground,Nor yet thou appearest."O hasten, 'tis our time,Ere yet the red summerScorch our delicate prime,Loved of bee, the tawny hummer."O pride of thy race!Sad in sooth it were to ours,If our brief tribe miss thy face,—We pour New England flowers."Fairest! choose the fairest membersOf our lithe society;June's glories and September'sShow our love and piety."Thou shalt command us all,April's cowslip, summer's cloverTo the gentian in the fall,Blue-eyed pet of blue-eyed lover."O come, then, quickly come,We are budding, we are blowing,And the wind which we perfumeSings a tune that's worth thy knowing."                                                 Thy trivial harp will never pleaseOr fill my craving ear;Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,Free, peremptory, clear.No jingling serenader's art,Nor tinkle of piano strings,Can make the wild blood startIn its mystic springs.The kingly bardMust smite the chords rudely and hard,As with hammer or with mace,That they may render backArtful thunder that conveysSecrets of the solar track,Sparks of the supersolar blaze.Merlin's blows are strokes of fate,Chiming with the forest-tone,When boughs buffet boughs in the wood;Chiming with the gasp and moanOf the ice-imprisoned flood;With the pulse of manly hearts,With the voice of orators,With the din of city arts,With the cannonade of wars.With the marches of the brave,And prayers of might from martyrs' cave.Great is the art,Great be the manners of the bard!He shall not his brain encumberWith the coil of rhythm and number,But, leaving rule and pale forethought,He shall aye climbFor his rhyme:Pass in, pass in, the angels say,In to the upper doors;Nor count compartments of the floors,But mount to ParadiseBy the stairway of surprise.Blameless master of the games,King of sport that never shames;He shall daily joy dispenseHid in song's sweet influence.Things more cheerly live and go,What time the subtle mindPlays aloud the tune wheretoTheir pulses beat,And march their feet,And their members are combined.By Sybarites beguiledHe shall no task decline;Merlin's mighty line,Extremes of nature reconciled,Bereaved a tyrant of his will,And made the lion mild.Songs can the tempest still,Scattered on the stormy air,Mould the year to fair increase,And bring in poetic peace.He shall not seek to weave,In weak unhappy times,Efficacious rhymes;Wait his returning strength,Bird, that from the nadir's floor,To the zenith's top could soar,The soaring orbit of the muse exceeds that journey's length!Nor, profane, affect to hitOr compass that by meddling wit,Which only the propitious mindPublishes when 'tis inclined.There are open hoursWhen the god's will sallies free,And the dull idiot might seeThe flowing fortunes of a thousand years;Sudden, at unawares,Self-moved fly-to the doors,Nor sword of angels could revealWhat they conceal.                                                 O Fair and stately maid, whose eyeWas kindled in the upper skyAt the same torch that lighted mine;For so I must interpret stillThy sweet dominion o'er my will,A sympathy divine.Ah! let me blameless gaze uponFeatures that seem in heart my own,Nor fear those watchful sentinelsWhich charm the more their glance forbids,Chaste glowing underneath their lidsWith fire that draws while it repels.Thine eyes still shined for me, though farI lonely roved the land or sea,As I behold yon evening star,Which yet beholds not me.This morn I climbed the misty hill,And roamed the pastures through;How danced thy form before my path,Amidst the deep-eyed dew!When the red bird spread his sable wing,And showed his side of flame,When the rose-bud ripened to the rose,In both I read thy name.                                                 The prosperous and beautifulTo me seem not to wearThe yoke of conscience masterful,Which galls me everywhere.I cannot shake off the god;On my neck he makes his seat;I look at my face in the glass,My eyes his eye-balls meet.Enchanters! enchantresses!Your gold makes you seem wise:The morning mist within your groundsMore proudly rolls, more softly lies.Yet spake yon purple mountain,Yet said yon ancient wood,That night or day, that love or crimeLead all souls to the Good.                                                 The rhyme of the poetModulates the king's affairs,Balance-loving natureMade all things in pairs.To every foot its antipode,Each color with its counter glowed,To every tone beat answering tones,Higher or graver;Flavor gladly blends with flavor;Leaf answers leaf upon the bough,And match the paired cotyledons.Hands to hands, and feet to feet,In one body grooms and brides;Eldest rite, two married sidesIn every mortal meet.Light's far furnace shines,Smelting balls and bars,Forging double stars,Glittering twins and trines.The animals are sick with love,Lovesick with rhyme;Each with all propitious TimeInto chorus wove.Like the dancers' ordered band,Thoughts come also hand in hand,In equal couples mated,Or else alternated,Adding by their mutual gageOne to other health and age.Solitary fancies goShort-lived wandering to and fro,Most like to bachelors,Or an ungiven maid,Not ancestors,With no posterity to make the lie afraid,Or keep truth undecayed.Perfect paired as eagle's wings,Justice is the rhyme of things;Trade and counting useThe serf-same tuneful muse;And Nemesis,Who with even matches odd,Who athwart space redressesThe partial wrong,Fills the just period,And finishes the song.Subtle rhymes with ruin rifeMurmur in the house of life,Sung by the Sisters as they spin;In perfect time and measure, theyBuild and unbuild our echoing clay,As the two twilights of the dayFold us music-drunken in.                                                 Your picture smiles as first it smiled,The ring you gave is still the same,Your letter tells, O changing child,No tidings since it came.Give me an amuletThat keeps intelligence with you,Red when you love, and rosier red,And when you love not, pale and blue.Alas, that neither bonds nor vowsCan certify possession;Torments me still the fear that loveDied in its last expression.                         Inscribed to W.H. ChanningThough loath to grieve The evil time's sole patriot, I cannot leave My honeyed thought For the priest's cant, Or statesman's rant. If I refuse My study for their politic, Which at the best is trick, The angry Muse Puts confusion in my brain. But who is he that prates Of the culture of mankind, Of better arts and life? Go, blindworm, go, Behold the famous States Harrying Mexico With rifle and with knife! Or who, with accent bolder Dare praise the freedom-loving mountaineer? I found by thee, O rushing Contoocook! And in thy valleys, Agiochook! The jackals of the Negro-holder. The God who made New Hampshire Taunted the lofty land With little men;-- Small bat and wren House in the oak:-- If earth-fire cleave The upheaved land, and bury the folk, The southern crocodile would grieve. Virtue palters; Right is hence; Freedom praised, but hid; Funeral eloquence Rattles the coffin lid. What boots thy zeal, O glowing friend, That would indignant rend The northland from the south? Wherefore? to what good end? Boston Bay and Bunker Hill Would serve things still;-- Things are of the snake. The horseman serves the horse The neatherd serves the neat, The merchant serves the purse, The eater serves his meat; 'Tis the day of the chattel, Web to weave, and corn to grind; Things are in the saddle, And ride mankind. There are two laws discrete, Not reconciled,-- Law for man, and law for thing; The last builds town and fleet, But it runs wild, And doth the man unking. 'Tis fit the forest fall, The steep be graded, The mountain tunneled, The sand shaded, The orchard planted, The glebe tilled, The prairie granted The steamer built. Let man serve law for man; Live for friendship, live for love, For truth's and harmony's behoof; The state may follow how it can, As Olympus follows Jove. Yet do not I implore The wrinkled shopman to my sounding woods, Nor did the unwilling senator Ask votes of thrushes in the solitudes. Everyone to his chosen work-- Foolish hands may mix and mar; Wise and sure the issues are. Round they roll till dark is light, Sex to sex, and even to odd;-- The overgod Who marries Right to Might, Who peoples, unpeoples,-- He who exterminates Races by stronger races, Black by white faces,-- Knows to bring honey Out of the lion; Grafts gentlest scion On pirate and Turk. The Cossack eats Poland, Like stolen fruit; Her last noble is ruined, Her last poet mute; Straight, into double band The victors divide; Half for freedom strike and stand;-- The astonished Muse finds thousands at her side.                                                 Trees in groves,Kine in droves,In ocean sport the scaly herds,Wedge-like cleave the air the birds,To northern lakes fly wind-borne ducks,Browse the mountain sheep in flocks,Men consort in camp and town,But the poet dwells alone.God who gave to him the lyre,Of all mortals the desire,For all breathing men's behoof,Straitly charged him, "Sit aloof;"Annexed a warning, poets say,To the bright premium,—Ever when twain together play,Shall the harp be dumb.Many may come,But one shall sing;Two touch the string,The harp is dumb.Though there come a millionWise Saadi dwells alone.Yet Saadi loved the race of men,—No churl immured in cave or den,—In bower and hallHe wants them all,Nor can dispenseWith Persia for his audience;They must give ear,Grow red with joy, and white with fear,Yet he has no companion,Come ten, or come a million,Good Saadi dwells alone.Be thou ware where Saadi dwells.Gladly round that golden lampSylvan deities encamp,And simple maids and noble youthAre welcome to the man of truth.Most welcome they who need him most,They feed the spring which they exhaust:For greater needDraws better deed:But, critic, spare thy vanity,Nor show thy pompous parts,To vex with odious subtletyThe cheerer of men's hearts.Sad-eyed Fakirs swiftly sayEndless dirges to decay;Never in the blaze of lightLose the shudder of midnight;And at overflowing noon,Hear wolves barking at the moon;In the bower of dalliance sweetHear the far Avenger's feet;And shake before those awful PowersWho in their pride forgive not ours.Thus the sad-eyed Fakirs preach;"Bard, when thee would Allah teach,And lift thee to his holy mount,He sends thee from his bitter fount,Wormwood; saying, Go thy ways,Drink not the Malaga of praise,But do the deed thy fellows hate,And compromise thy peaceful state.Smite the white breasts which thee fed,Stuff sharp thorns beneath the headOf them thou shouldst have comforted.For out of woe and out of crimeDraws the heart a lore sublime."And yet it seemeth not to meThat the high gods love tragedy;For Saadi sat in the sun,And thanks was his contrition;For haircloth and for bloody whips,Had active hands and smiling lips;And yet his runes he rightly read,And to his folk his message sped.Sunshine in his heart transferredLighted each transparent word;And well could honoring Persia learnWhat Saadi wished to say;For Saadi's nightly stars did burnBrighter than Dschami's day.Whispered the muse in Saadi's cot;O gentle Saadi, listen not,Tempted by thy praise of wit,Or by thirst and appetiteFor the talents not thine own,To sons of contradiction.Never, sun of eastern morning,Follow falsehood, follow scorning,Denounce who will, who will, deny,And pile the hills to scale the sky;Let theist, atheist, pantheist,Define and wrangle how they list,—Fierce conserver, fierce destroyer,But thou joy-giver and enjoyer,Unknowing war, unknowing crime,Gentle Saadi, mind thy rhyme.Heed not what the brawlers say,Heed thou only Saadi's lay.Let the great world bustle onWith war and trade, with camp and town.A thousand men shall dig and eat,At forge and furnace thousands sweat,And thousands sail the purple sea,And give or take the stroke of war,Or crowd the market and bazaar.Oft shall war end, and peace return,And cities rise where cities burn,Ere one man my hill shall climb,Who can turn the golden rhyme;Let them manage how they may,Heed thou only Saadi's lay.Seek the living among the dead:Man in man is imprisoned.Barefooted Dervish is not poor,If fate unlock his bosom's door.So that what his eye hath seenHis tongue can paint, as bright, as keen,And what his tender heart hath felt,With equal fire thy heart shall melt.For, whom the muses shine upon,And touch with soft persuasion,His words like a storm-wind can bringTerror and beauty on their wing;In his every syllableLurketh nature veritable;And though he speak in midnight dark,In heaven, no star; on earth, no spark;Yet before the listener's eyeSwims the world in ecstasy,The forest waves, the morning breaks,The pastures sleep, ripple the lakes,Leaves twinkle, flowers like persons be,And life pulsates in rock or tree.Saadi! so far thy words shall reach;Suns rise and set in Saadi's speech.And thus to Saadi said the muse;Eat thou the bread which men refuse;Flee from the goods which from thee flee;Seek nothing; Fortune seeketh thee.Nor mount, nor dive; all good things keepThe midway of the eternal deep;Wish not to fill the isles with eyesTo fetch thee birds of paradise;On thine orchard's edge belongAll the brass of plume and song;Wise Ali's sunbright sayings passFor proverbs in the market-place;Through mountains bored by regal artToil whistles as he drives his cart.Nor scour the seas, nor sift mankind,A poet or a friend to find;Behold, he watches at the door,Behold his shadow on the floor.Open innumerable doors,The heaven where unveiled Allah poursThe flood of truth, the flood of good,The seraph's and the cherub's food;Those doors are men; the pariah kindAdmits thee to the perfect Mind.Seek not beyond thy cottage wallRedeemer that can yield thee all.While thou sittest at thy door,On the desert's yellow floor,Listening to the gray-haired crones,Foolish gossips, ancient drones,—Saadi, see, they rise in statureTo the height of mighty nature,And the secret stands revealedFraudulent Time in vain concealed,That blessed gods in servile masksPlied for thee thy household tasks.                                                 It is time to be old, To take in sail:-- The god of bounds, Who sets to seas a shore, Come to me in his fatal rounds, And said: "No more! No farther shoot Thy broad ambitious branches, and thy root. Fancy departs; no more invent; Contract thy firmament To compass of a tent. There's not enough for this and that, Make thy option which of two; Economize the failing river, Not the less revere the Giver, Leave the many and hold the few. Timely wise accept the terms, Soften the fall with wary foot; A little while Still plan and smile, And,--fault of novel germs,-- Mature the unfallen fruit. Curse, if thou wilt, thy sires, Bad husbands of their fires, Who, when they gave thee breath, Failed to bequeath The needful sinew stark as once. The baresark marrow to thy bones, But left a legacy of ebbing veins, Inconstant heat and nerveless reins,-- Amid the Muses, left thee deaf and dumb, Amid the gladiators, halt and numb." As the bird trims her to the gale, I trim myself to the storm of time, I man the rudder, reef the sail, Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime: "Lowly faithful, banish fear, Right onward drive unharmed; The port, well worth the cruise, is near, And every wave is charmed."                                                 Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, Flint, Possessed the land which rendered to their toil Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool and wood. Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm, Saying, "'Tis mine, my children's and my name's. How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees! How graceful climb those shadows on my hill! I fancy these pure waters and the flags Know me, as does my dog: we sympathize; And, I affirm, my actions smack of the soil.' Where are these men? Asleep beneath their grounds: And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough. Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boys Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs; Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet Clear of the grave. They added ridge to valley, brook to pond, And sighed for all that bounded their domain; 'This suits me for a pasture; that's my park; We must have clay, lime, gravel, granite-ledge, And misty lowland, where to go for peat. The land is well,--lies fairly to the south. 'Tis good, when you have crossed the sea and back, To find the sitfast acres where you left them.' Ah! the hot owner sees not Death, who adds Him to his land, a lump of mould the more. Hear what the Earth says:-- Earth-Song'Mine and yours; Mine, not yours, Earth endures; Stars abide-- Shine down in the old sea; Old are the shores; But where are old men? I who have seen much, Such have I never seen. 'The lawyer's deed Ran sure, In tail, To them, and to their heirs Who shall succeed, Without fail, Forevermore. 'Here is the land, Shaggy with wood, With its old valley, Mound and flood. "But the heritors?-- Fled like the flood's foam. The lawyer, and the laws, And the kingdom, Clean swept herefrom. 'They called me theirs, Who so controlled me; Yet every one Wished to stay, and is gone, How am I theirs, If they cannot hold me, But I hold them?'When I heard the Earth-song, I was no longer brave; My avarice cooled Like lust in the chill of the grave.                                                 They brought me rubies from the mine, And held them to the sun; I said, they are drops of frozen wine From Eden's vats that run. I looked again,--I thought them hearts Of friends to friends unknown; Tides that should warm each neighboring life Are locked in sparkling stone. But fire to thaw that ruddy snow, To break enchanted ice, And give love's scarlet tides to flow,-- When shall that sun arise?                                                 I heard or seemed to hear the chiding Sea Say, Pilgrim, why so late and slow to come? Am I not always here, thy summer home? Is not my voice thy music, morn and eve? My breath thy healthful climate in the heats, My touch thy antidote, my bay thy bath? Was ever building like my terraces? Was ever couch magnificent as mine? Lie on the warm rock-ledges, and there learn A little hut suffices like a town. I make your sculptured architecture vain, Vain beside mine. I drive my wedges home, And carve the coastwise mountain into caves. Lo! here is Rome and Nineveh and Thebes, Karnak and Pyramid and Giant's Stairs Half piled or prostrate; and my newest slab Older than all thy race. Behold the Sea, The opaline, the plentiful and strong, Yet beautiful as is the rose in June, Fresh as the trickling rainbow of July; Sea full of food, the nourisher of kinds, Purger of earth, and medicine of men; Creating a sweet climate by my breath, Washing out harms and griefs from memory, And, in my mathematic ebb and flow, Giving a hint of that which changes not. Rich are the sea-gods:--who gives gifts but they? They grope the sea for pearls, but more than pearls: They pluck Force thence, and give it to the wise. For every wave is wealth to Dædalus, Wealth to the cunning artist who can work This matchless strength. Where shall he find, O waves! A load your Atlas shoulders cannot lift? I with my hammer pounding evermore The rocky coast, smite Andes into dust, Strewing my bed, and, in another age, Rebuild a continent of better men. Then I unbar the doors: my paths lead out The exodus of nations: I dispersed Men to all shores that front the hoary main. I too have arts and sorceries; Illusion dwells forever with the wave. I know what spells are laid. Leave me to deal With credulous and imaginative man; For, though he scoop my water in his palm, A few rods off he deems it gems and clouds. Planting strange fruits and sunshine on the shore, I make some coast alluring, some lone isle, To distant men, who must go there, or die.                                                 The lords of life, the lords of life,-I saw them pass,In their own guise,Like and unlike,Portly and grim,Use and Surprise,Surface and Dream,Succession swift, and spectral Wrong,Temperament without a tongue,And the inventor of the gameOmnipresent without name;-Some to see, some to be guessed,They marched from east to west:Little man, least of all,Among the legs of his guardians tall,Walked about with puzzled look:-Him by the hand dear nature took;Dearest nature, strong and kind,Whispered, 'Darling, never mind!Tomorrow they will wear another face,The founder thou! these are thy race!'                                                 The sinful painter drapes his goddess warm,Because she still is naked, being drest;The godlike sculptor will not so deformBeauty, which bones and flesh enough invest.                                                 Venus, when her son was lost,Cried him up and down the coast,In hamlets, palaces, and parks,And told the truant by his marks,Golden curls, and quiver, and bow;—This befell long ago.Time and tide are strangely changed,Men and manners much deranged;None will now find Cupid latentBy this foolish antique patent.He came late along the waste,Shod like a traveller for haste,With malice dared me to proclaim him,That the maids and boys might name him.Boy no more, he wears all coats,Frocks, and blouses, capes, capôtes,He bears no bow, or quiver, or wand,Nor chaplet on his head or hand:Leave his weeds and heed his eyes,All the rest he can disguise.In the pit of his eyes a sparkWould bring back day if it were dark,And,—if I tell you all my thought,Though I comprehend it not,—In those unfathomable orbsEvery function he absorbs;He doth eat, and drink, and fish, and shoot,And write, and reason, and compute,And ride, and run, and have, and hold,And whine, and flatter, and regret,And kiss, and couple, and beget,By those roving eye-balls bold;Undaunted are their courages,Right Cossacks in their forages;Fleeter they than any creature,They are his steeds and not his feature,Inquisitive, and fierce, and fasting,Restless, predatory, hasting,—And they pounce on other eyes,As lions on their prey;And round their circles is writ,Plainer than the day,Underneath, within, above,Love, love, love, love.He lives in his eyes,There doth digest, and work, and spin,And buy, and sell, and lose, and win;He rolls them with delighted motion,Joy-tides swell their mimic ocean.Yet holds he them with tortest rein,That they may seize and entertainThe glance that to their glance opposes,Like fiery honey sucked from roses.He palmistry can understand,Imbibing virtue by his handAs if it were a living root;The pulse of hands will make him mute;With all his force he gathers balmsInto those wise thrilling palms.Cupid is a casuist,A mystic, and a cabalist,Can your lurking Thought surprise,And interpret your device;Mainly versed in occult science,In magic, and in clairvoyance.Oft he keeps his fine ear strained,And reason on her tiptoe pained,For aery intelligence,And for strange coincidence.But it touches his quick heartWhen Fate by omens takes his part,And chance-dropt hints from Nature's sphereDeeply soothe his anxious ear.Heralds high before him run,He has ushers many a one,Spreads his welcome where he goes,And touches all things with his rose.All things wait for and divine him,—How shall I dare to malign him,Or accuse the god of sport?—I must end my true report,Painting him from head to foot,In as far as I took note,Trusting well the matchless powerOf this young-eyed emperorWill clear his fame from every cloud,With the bards, and with the crowd.He is wilful, mutable,Shy, untamed, inscrutable,Swifter-fashioned than the fairies,Substance mixed of pure contraries,His vice some elder virtue's token,And his good is evil spoken.Failing sometimes of his own,He is headstrong and alone;He affects the wood and wild,Like a flower-hunting child,Buries himself in summer waves,In trees, with beasts, in mines, and caves,Loves nature like a horned cow,Bird, or deer, or cariboo.Shun him, nymphs, on the fleet horses!He has a total world of wit,O how wise are his discourses!But he is the arch-hypocrite,And through all science and all art,Seeks alone his counterpart.He is a Pundit of the east,He is an augur and a priest,And his soul will melt in prayer,But word and wisdom are a snare;Corrupted by the present toy,He follows joy, and only joy.There is no mask but he will wear,He invented oaths to swear,He paints, he carves, he chants, he prays,And holds all stars in his embrace,Godlike, —but 'tis for his fine pelf,The social quintessence of self.Well, said I, he is hypocrite,And folly the end of his subtle wit,He takes a sovran privilegeNot allowed to any liege,For he does go behind all law,And right into himself does draw,For he is sovranly allied.Heaven's oldest blood flows in his side,And interchangeably at oneWith every king on every throne,That no God dare say him nay,Or see the fault, or seen betray;He has the Muses by the heart,And the Parcæ all are of his part.His many signs cannot be told,He has not one mode, but manifold,Many fashions and addresses,Piques, reproaches, hurts, caresses,Action, service, badinage,He will preach like a friar,And jump like Harlequin,He will read like a crier,And fight like a Paladin.Boundless is his memory,Plans immense his term prolong,He is not of counted age,Meaning always to be young.And his wish is intimacy,Intimater intimacy,And a stricter privacy,The impossible shall yet be done,And being two shall still be one.As the wave breaks to foam on shelves,Then runs into a wave again,So lovers melt their sundered selves,Yet melted would be twain.                                                 HENCEFORTH, please God, forever I foregoThe yoke of men's opinions. I will beLight-hearted as a bird, and live with God.I find him in the bottom of my heart,I hear continually his voice therein.horizontal dotted lineThe little needle always knows the North,The little bird remembereth his note,And this wise Seer within me never errs.I never taught it what it teaches me;I only follow, when I act aright.                                                 Give me truths,For I am weary of the surfaces,And die of inanition. If I knewOnly the herbs and simples of the wood,Rue, cinquefoil, gill, vervain, and pimpernel,Blue-vetch, and trillium, hawkweed, sassafras,Milkweeds, and murky brakes, quaint pipes and sundew,And rare and virtuous roots, which in these woodsDraw untold juices from the common earth,Untold, unknown, and I could surely spellTheir fragrance, and their chemistry applyBy sweet affinities to human flesh,Driving the foe and stablishing the friend,—O that were much, and I could be a partOf the round day, related to the sun,And planted world, and full executorOf their imperfect functions. But these young scholars who invade our hills,Bold as the engineer who fells the wood,And travelling often in the cut he makes,Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not,And all their botany is Latin names.The old men studied magic in the flower,And human fortunes in astronomy,And an omnipotence in chemistry,Preferring things to names, for these were men,Were unitarians of the united world,And wheresoever their clear eyebeams fell,They caught the footsteps of the SAME. Our eyesAre armed, but we are strangers to the stars,And strangers to the mystic beast and bird,And strangers to the plant and to the mine;The injured elements say, Not in us;And night and day, ocean and continent,Fire, plant, and mineral say, Not in us,And haughtily return us stare for stare.For we invade them impiously for gain,We devastate them unreligiously,And coldly ask their pottage, not their love,Therefore they shove us from them, yield to usOnly what to our griping toil is due;But the sweet affluence of love and song,The rich results of the divine consentsOf man and earth, of world beloved and lover,The nectar and ambrosia are withheld;And in the midst of spoils and slaves, we thievesAnd pirates of the universe, shut outDaily to a more thin and outward rind,Turn pale and starve. Therefore to our sick eyes,The stunted trees look sick, the summer short,Clouds shade the sun, which will not tan our hay.And nothing thrives to reach its natural term,And life, shorn of its venerable length,Even at its greatest space, is a defeat,And dies in anger that it was a dupe,And, in its highest noon and wantonness,Is early frugal like a beggar's child:With most unhandsome calculation taught,Even in the hot pursuit of the best aimsAnd prizes of ambition, checks its hand,Like Alpine cataracts, frozen as they leaped,Chilled with a miserly comparisonOf the toy's purchase with the length of life.                                                 The Sphinx is drowsy,The wings are furled;Her ear is heavy,She broods on the world."Who'll tell me my secret,The ages have kept?--I awaited the seer,While they slumbered and slept;--"The fate of the man-child;The meaning of man;Known fruit of the unknown;Daedalian plan;Out of sleeping a waking,Out of waking a sleep;Life death overtaking;Deep underneath deep?"Erect as a sunbeam,Upspringeth the palm;The elephant browses,Undaunted and calm;In beautiful motionThe thrush plies his wings;Kind leaves of his covert,Your silence he sings."The waves, unashamed,In difference sweet,Play glad with the breezes,Old playfellows meet;The journeying atoms,Primordial wholes,Firmly draw, firmly drive,By their animate poles."Sea, earth, air, sound, silence,Plant, quadruped, bird,By one music enchanted,One deity stirred,--Each the other adorning,Accompany still;Night veileth the morning,The vapor the hill."The babe by its motherLies bathed in joy;Glide its hours uncounted,--The sun is its toy;Shines the peace of all being,Without cloud, in its eyes;And the sum of the worldIn soft miniature lies."But man crouches and blushes,Absconds and conceals;He creepeth and peepeth,He palters and steals;Infirm, melancholy,Jealous glancing around,An oaf, an accomplice,He poisons the ground."Outspoke the great mother,Beholding his fear;--At the sound of her accentsCold shuddered the sphere:--'Who has drugged my boy's cup?Who has mixed my boy's bread?Who, with sadness and madness,Has turned the man-child's head?'" I heard a poet answer,Aloud and cheerfully,"Say on, sweet Sphinx! thy dirgesAre pleasant songs to me.Deep love lieth underThese pictures of time; They fad in the light ofTheir meaning sublime."The fiend that man harriesIs love of the Best;Yawns the pit of the Dragon,Lit by rays from the Blest.The Lethe of natureCan't trace him again,Whose soul sees the perfect,Which his eyes seek in vain."Profounder, profounder,Man's spirit must dive;To his aye-rolling orbitNo goal will arrive;The heavens that now draw himWith sweetness untold,Once found,--for new heavensHe spurneth the old."Pride ruined the angels,Their shame them restores;And the joy that is sweetestLurks in stings of remorse.Have I a loverWho is noble and free?--I would he were noblerThan to love me."Eterne alternationNow follows, now flied;And under pain, pleasure,--Under pleasure, pain lies.Love works at the centre,Heart-heaving alway;Forth speed the strong pulsesTo the borders of day."Dull Sphinx, Jove keep thy five wits!Thy sight is growing blear;Rue, myrrh, and cummin for the Sphinx--Her muddy eyes to clear!"--The old Sphinx bit her thick lip,--Said, "Who taught thee me to name?I am thy spirit, yoke-fellow,Of thine eye I am eyebeam."Thou art the unanswered question;Couldst see they proper eye,Alway it asketh, asketh;And each answer is a lie.So take thy quest through nature,It through thousand natures ply;Ask on, thou clothed eternity;Time is the false reply."Uprose the merry Sphinx,And crouched no more in stone;She melted into purple cloud,She silvered in the moon;She spired into a yellow flame;She flowered in blossoms red;She flowed into a foaming wave;She stood Monadnoc's head.Through a thousand voicesSpoke the universal dame:"Who telleth one of my meanings,Is master of all I am."                                                 I like the church; I like a cowl; I love a prophet of the soul; And on my heart monastic aisles Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles; Yet not for all his faith can see Would I that cowlèd churchman be. Why should the vest on him allure, Which I could not on me endure? Not from a vain or shallow thought His awful Jove young Phidias brought; Never from lips of cunning fell The thrilling Delphic oracle; Out from the heart of nature rolled The burdens of the Bible old; The litanies of nations came, Like the volcano's tongue of flame, Up from the burning core below,-- The canticles of love and woe: The hand that rounded Peter's dome And groined the aisles of Christian Rome Wrought in a sad sincerity; Himself from God he could not free; He builded better than he knew;-- The conscious stone to beauty grew. Knowst thou what wove yon wood bird's nest Of leaves and feathers from her breast? Or how the fish outbuilt her shell, Painting with morn each annual cell? Or how the sacred pine tree adds To her old leaves new myriads? Such and so grew these holy piles, Whilst love and terror laid the tiles. Earth proudly wears the Parthenon, As the best gem upon her zone, And Morning opes with haste her lids To gaze upon the Pyramids; O'er England's abbeys bends the sky, As on its friends, with kindred eye; For out of Thought's interior sphere These wonders rose to upper air; And Nature gladly gave them place, Adopted them into her race, And granted them an equal date With Andes and with Ararat. These temples grew as grows the grass; Art might obey, but not surpass. The passive Master lent his hand To the vast soul that o'er him planned; And the same power that reared the shrine Bestrode the tribes that knelt within. Ever the fiery Pentecost Girds with one flame the countless host, Trances the heart through chanting choirs, And through the priest the mind inspires. The word unto the prophet spoken Was writ on tables yet unbroken; The word by seers or sibyls told, In groves of oak, or fames of gold, Still floats upon the morning wind, Still whispters to the willing mind. One accent of the Holy Ghost The heedless world hath never lost. I know what say the fathers wise,-- The Book itself before me lies, Old Chrysostom, best Augustine, And he who blent both in his line, The younger Golden Lips or mines, Taylor, the Shakespeare of divines. His words are music in my ear. I see his cowlèd portrait dear; And yet, for all his faith could see, I would not the good bishop be.                                                 Already blushes in thy cheek The bosom-thought which thou must speak; The bird, how far it haply roam By cloud or isle, is flying home; The maiden fears, and fearing runs Into the charmed snare she shuns; And every man, in love or pride, Of his fate is never wide. Will a woman's fan the ocean smooth? Or prayers the stony Parcae sooth, Or coax the thunder from its mark? Or tapers light the chaos dark? In spite of Virtue and the Muse, Nemesis will have her dues, And all our struggles and our toils Tighter wind the giant coils.                                                 This is he, who, felled by foes,  Sprung harmless up, refreshed by blows  He to captivity was sold,  But him no prison-bars would hold:  Though they sealed him in a rock,          Mountain chains he can unlock:  Thrown to lions for their meat,  The crouching lion kissed his feet:  Bound to the stake, no flames appalled,  But arched o’er him an honouring vault.         This is he men miscall Fate,  Threading dark ways, arriving late,  But ever coming in time to crown  The truth, and hurl wrong-doers down.  He is the oldest, and best known,         More near than aught thou call’st thy own,  Yet, greeted in another’s eyes,  Disconcerts with glad surprise.  This is Jove, who, deaf to prayers,  Floods with blessings unawares.         Draw, if thou canst, the mystic line  Severing rightly his from thine,  Which is human, which divine.                                                 I serve you not, if you I follow,Shadow-like, o'er hill and hollow,And bend my fancy to your leading,All too nimble for my treading.When the pilgrimage is done,And we've the landscape overrun,I am bitter, vacant, thwarted,And your heart is unsupported.Vainly valiant, you have missedThe manhood that should yours resist,Its complement; but if I couldIn severe or cordial moodLead you rightly to my altar,Where the wisest muses falter,And worship that world-warning sparkWhich dazzles me in midnight dark,Equalizing small and large,While the soul it doth surcharge,That the poor is wealthy grown,And the hermit never alone,The traveller and the road seem oneWith the errand to be done;—That were a man's and lover's part,That were Freedom's whitest chart.                                                 I rake no coffined clay, nor publish wideThe resurrection of departed pride.Safe in their ancient crannies, dark and deep,Let kings and conquerors, saints and soldiers sleep--Late in the world,--too late perchance for fame,Just late enough to reap abundant blame,--I choose a novel theme, a bold abuseOf critic charters, an unlaurelled Muse.Old mouldy men and books and names and landsDisgust my reason and defile my hands.I had as lief respect an ancient shoe,As love old things for age, and hate the new.I spurn the Past, my mind disdains its nod,Nor kneels in homage to so mean a God.I laugh at those who, while they gape and gaze,The bald antiquity of China praise.Youth is (whatever cynic tubs pretend)The fault that boys and nations soonest mend.                                                 Hast thou named all the birds without a gun;Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk;At rich men's tables eaten bread and pulse;Unarmed, faced danger with a heart of trust;And loved so well a high behaviorIn man or maid, that thou from speech refrained,Nobility more nobly to repay?—O be my friend, and teach me to be thine!                                                 The south-wind bringsLife, sunshine, and desire,And on every mount and meadowBreathes aromatic fire,But over the dead he has no power,The lost, the lost he cannot restore,And, looking over the hills, I mournThe darling who shall not return.I see my empty house,I see my trees repair their boughs,And he, —the wondrous child,Whose silver warble wildOutvalued every pulsing soundWithin the air's cerulean round,The hyacinthine boy, for whomMorn well might break, and April bloom,The gracious boy, who did adornThe world whereinto he was born,And by his countenance repayThe favor of the loving Day,Has disappeared from the Day's eye;Far and wide she cannot find him,My hopes pursue, they cannot bind him.Returned this day the south-wind searchesAnd finds young pines and budding birches,But finds not the budding man;Nature who lost him, cannot remake him;Fate let him fall, Fate can't retake him;Nature, Fate, men, him seek in vain.And whither now, my truant wise and sweet,Oh, whither tend thy feet?I had the right, few days ago,Thy steps to watch, thy place to know;How have I forfeited the right?Hast thou forgot me in a new delight?I hearken for thy household cheer,O eloquent child!Whose voice, an equal messenger,Conveyed thy meaning mild.What though the pains and joysWhereof it spoke were toysFitting his age and ken;—Yet fairest dames and bearded men,Who heard the sweet requestSo gentle, wise, and grave,Bended with joy to his behest,And let the world's affairs go by,Awhile to share his cordial game,Or mend his wicker wagon frame,Still plotting how their hungry earThat winsome voice again might hear,For his lips could well pronounceWords that were persuasions.Gentlest guardians marked sereneHis early hope, his liberal mien,Took counsel from his guiding eyesTo make this wisdom earthly wise.Ah! vainly do these eyes recallThe school-march, each day's festival,When every morn my bosom glowedTo watch the convoy on the road;—The babe in willow wagon closed,With rolling eyes and face composed,With children forward and behind,Like Cupids studiously inclined,And he, the Chieftain, paced beside,The centre of the troop allied,With sunny face of sweet repose,To guard the babe from fancied foes,The little Captain innocentTook the eye with him as he went,Each village senior paused to scanAnd speak the lovely caravan.From the window I look outTo mark thy beautiful paradeStately marching in cap and coatTo some tune by fairies played;A music heard by thee aloneTo works as noble led thee on.Now love and pride, alas, in vain,Up and down their glances strain.The painted sled stands where it stood,The kennel by the corded wood,The gathered sticks to stanch the wallOf the snow-tower, when snow should fall,The ominous hole he dug in the sand,And childhood's castles built or planned.His daily haunts I well discern,The poultry yard, the shed, the barn,And every inch of garden groundPaced by the blessed feet around,From the road-side to the brook;Whereinto he loved to look.Step the meek birds where erst they ranged,The wintry garden lies unchanged,The brook into the stream runs on,But the deep-eyed Boy is gone.On that shaded day,Dark with more clouds than tempests are,When thou didst yield thy innocent breathIn bird-like heavings unto death,Night came, and Nature had not thee,—I said, we are mates in misery.The morrow dawned with needless glow,Each snow-bird chirped, each fowl must crow,Each tramper started,— but the feetOf the most beautiful and sweetOf human youth had left the hillAnd garden,—they were bound and still,There's not a sparrow or a wren,There's not a blade of autumn grain,Which the four seasons do not tend,And tides of life and increase lend,And every chick of every bird,And weed and rock-moss is preferred.O ostriches' forgetfulness!O loss of larger in the less!Was there no star that could be sent,No watcher in the firmament,No angel from the countless host,That loiters round the crystal coast,Could stoop to heal that only child,Nature's sweet marvel undefiled,And keep the blossom of the earth,Which all her harvests were not worth?Not mine, I never called thee mine,But nature's heir,— if I repine,And, seeing rashly torn and moved,Not what I made, but what I loved.Grow early old with grief that thenMust to the wastes of nature go,—'Tis because a general hopeWas quenched, and all must doubt and gropeFor flattering planets seemed to say,This child should ills of ages stay,—By wondrous tongue and guided penBring the flown muses back to men. —Perchance, not he, but nature ailed,The world, and not the infant failed,It was not ripe yet, to sustainA genius of so fine a strain,Who gazed upon the sun and moonAs if he came unto his own,And pregnant with his grander thought,Brought the old order into doubt.Awhile his beauty their beauty tried,They could not feed him, and he died,And wandered backward as in scornTo wait an Æon to be born.Ill day which made this beauty waste;Plight broken, this high face defaced!Some went and came about the dead,And some in books of solace read,Some to their friends the tidings say,Some went to write, some went to pray,One tarried here, there hurried one,But their heart abode with none.Covetous death bereaved us allTo aggrandize one funeral.The eager Fate which carried theeTook the largest part of me.For this losing is true dying,This is lordly man's down-lying,This is slow but sure reclining,Star by star his world resigning.O child of Paradise!Boy who made dear his father's homeIn whose deep eyesMen read the welfare of the times to come;I am too much bereft;The world dishonored thou hast left;O truths and natures costly lie;O trusted, broken prophecy!O richest fortune sourly crossed;Born for the future, to the future lost!The deep Heart answered, Weepest thou?Worthier cause for passion wild,If I had not taken the child.And deemest thou as those who poreWith aged eyes short way before?Think'st Beauty vanished from the coastOf matter, and thy darling lost?Taught he not thee, — the man of eld,Whose eyes within his eyes beheldHeaven's numerous hierarchy spanThe mystic gulf from God to man?To be alone wilt thou begin,When worlds of lovers hem thee in?To-morrow, when the masks shall fallThat dizen nature's carnival,The pure shall see, by their own will,Which overflowing love shall fill,—'Tis not within the force of FateThe fate-conjoined to separate.But thou, my votary, weepest thou?I gave thee sight, where is it now?I taught thy heart beyond the reachOf ritual, Bible, or of speech;Wrote in thy mind's transparent tableAs far as the incommunicable;Taught thee each private sign to raiseLit by the supersolar blaze.Past utterance and past belief,And past the blasphemy of grief,The mysteries of nature's heart,—And though no muse can these impart,Throb thine with nature's throbbing breast,And all is clear from east to west.I came to thee as to a friend,Dearest, to thee I did not sendTutors, but a joyful eye,Innocence that matched the sky,Lovely locks a form of wonder,Laughter rich as woodland thunder;That thou might'st entertain apartThe richest flowering of all art;And, as the great all-loving DayThrough smallest chambers takes its way,That thou might'st break thy daily breadWith Prophet, Saviour, and head;That thou might'st cherish for thine ownThe riches of sweet Mary's Son,Boy-Rabbi, Israel's Paragon:And thoughtest thou such guestWould in thy hall take up his rest?Would rushing life forget its laws,Fate's glowing revolution pause?High omens ask diviner guess,Not to be conned to tediousness.And know, my higher gifts unbindThe zone that girds the incarnate mind,When the scanty shores are fullWith Thought's perilous whirling pool,When frail Nature can no more,—Then the spirit strikes the hour,My servant Death with solving ritePours finite into infinite.Wilt thou freeze love's tidal flow,Whose streams through nature circling go?Nail the star struggling to its trackOn the half-climbed Zodiack?Light is light which radiates,Blood is blood which circulates,Life is life which generates,And many-seeming life is one,—Wilt thou transfix and make it none,Its onward stream too starkly pentIn figure, bone, and lineament?Wilt thou uncalled interrogateTalker! the unreplying fate?Nor see the Genius of the wholeAscendant in the private soul,Beckon it when to go and come,Self-announced its hour of doom.Fair the soul's recess and shrine,Magic-built, to last a season,Masterpiece of love benign!Fairer than expansive reasonWhose omen 'tis, and sign.Wilt thou not ope this heart to knowWhat rainbows teach and sunsets show,Verdict which accumulatesFrom lengthened scroll of human fates,Voice of earth to earth returned,Prayers of heart that inly burned;Saying, what is excellent, As God lives, is permanent Hearts are dust, hearts' loves remain, Heart's love will meet thee again. Revere the Maker; fetch thine eyeUp to His style, and manners of the sky.Not of adamant and goldBuilt He heaven stark and cold,No, but a nest of bending reeds,Flowering grass and scented weeds,Or like a traveller's fleeting tent,Or bow above the tempest pent,Built of tears and sacred flames,And virtue reaching to its aims;Built of furtherance and pursuing,Not of spent deeds, but of doing.Silent rushes the swift LordThrough ruined systems still restored,Broad-sowing, bleak and void to bless,Plants with worlds the wilderness,Waters with tears of ancient sorrowApples of Eden ripe to-morrow;House and tenant go to ground,Lost in God, in Godhead found.                         On being asked, Whence is the flower?In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,To please the desert and the sluggish brook.The purple petals, fallen in the pool,Made the black water with their beauty gay;Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,And court the flower that cheapens his array.Rhodora! if the sages ask thee whyThis charm is wasted on the earth and sky,Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,Then Beauty is its own excuse for being:Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!I never thought to ask, I never knew:But, in my simple ignorance, supposeThe self-same Power that brought me there brought you.                                                 "May be true what I had heard,Earth's a howling wildernessTruculent with fraud and force,"Said I, strolling through the pastures,And along the riverside.Caught among the blackberry vines,Feeding on the Ethiops sweet,Pleasant fancies overtook me:I said, "What influence me preferredElect to dreams thus beautiful?"The vines replied, "And didst thou deemNo wisdom to our berries went?"                                                 Who shall tell what did befall, Far away in time, when once, Over the lifeless ball, Hung idle stars and suns? What god the element obeyed? Wings of what wind the lichen bore, Wafting the puny seeds of power, Which, lodged in rock, the rock abrade? And well the primal pioneer Knew the strong task to it assigned, Patient through Heaven's enormous year To build in matter home for mind. From air the creeping centuries drew The matted thicked low and wide, This must the leaves of ages strew The granite slab to clothe and hide, Ere wheat can wave its golden pride. What smiths, and in what furnace, rolled (In dizzy aeons dim and mute The reeling brain can ill compute) Copper and iron, lead and gold? What oldest star the fame can save Of races perishing to pave The planet with a floor of lime? Dust is their pyramid and mole: Who saw that ferns and palms were pressed Under the trembling mountain's breast, In the safe herbal of the coal? But when the quarried means were piled, All is waste and worthless, till Arrives the wise selecting will, And,out of slime and chaos, Wit Draws the threads of fair and fit. Then temples rose, and towns, and marts, The shop of toil, the hall of arts; Then flew the sail across the seas To feed the North from tropic trees; The storm-wind wove, the torrent span, Where they were bid the rivers ran; New slaves fulfilled the poet's dream, Galvanic wire, strong-shouldered steam. Then docks were built, and crops were stored, And ingots added to the hoard. But, though light-hearted man forget, Remembering Matter pays her debt: Still, though her motes and masses, draw Electric thrills and ties of Law, Which bind the strength of Nature wild To the conscience of a child.                                                 I Alphonso live and learn,Seeing nature go astern.Things deteriorate in kind,Lemons run to leaves and rind,Meagre crop of figs and limes,Shorter days and harder times.Flowering April cools and diesIn the insufficient skies;Imps at high Midsummer blotHalf the sun's disk with a spot;'Twill not now avail to tanOrange cheek, or skin of man:Roses bleach, the goats are dry,Lisbon quakes, the people cry.Yon pale scrawny fisher fools,Gaunt as bitterns in the pools,Are no brothers of my blood,—They discredit Adamhood.Eyes of gods! ye must have seen,O'er your ramparts as ye lean,The general debility,Of genius the sterility,Mighty projects countermanded,Rash ambition broken-handed,Puny man and scentless roseTormenting Pan to double the dose.Rebuild or ruin: either fillOf vital force the wasted rill,Or, tumble all again in heapTo weltering chaos, and to sleep.Say, Seigneurs, are the old Niles dry,Which fed the veins of earth and sky,That mortals miss the loyal heatsWhich drove them erst to social feats,Now to a savage selfness grown,Think nature barely serves for one;With. science poorly mask their hurt,And vex the gods with question pert,Immensely curious whether youStill are rulers, or Mildew.Masters, I'm in pain with you;Masters, I'll be plain with you.In my palace of Castile,I, a king, for kings can feel;There my thoughts the matter roll,And solve and oft resolve the whole,And, for I'm styled Alphonse the Wise,Ye shall not fail for sound advice,Before ye want a drop of rain,Hear the sentiment of Spain.You have tried famine: no more try it;Ply us now with a full diet;Teach your pupils now with plenty,For one sun supply us twenty:I have thought it thoroughly over,State of hermit, state of lover;We must have society,We cannot spare variety.Hear you, then, celestial fellows!Fits not to be over zealous;Steads not to work on the clean jump,Nor wine nor brains perpetual pump;Men and gods are too extense,—Could you slacken and condense?Your rank overgrowths reduce,Till your kinds abound with juice;Earth crowded cries, "Too many men,"—My counsel is, Kill nine in ten,And bestow the shares of allOn the remnant decimal.Add their nine lives to this cat;Stuff their nine brains in his hat;Make his frame and forces squareWith the labors he must dare;Thatch his flesh, and even his yearsWith the marble which he rears;There growing slowly old at ease,No faster than his planted trees,He may, by warrant of his age,In schemes of broader scope engage:So shall ye have a man of the sphere,Fit to grace the solar year.                                                 BRING me wine, but wine which never grew In the belly of the grape, Or grew on vine whose tap-roots, reaching through Under the Andes to the Cape, Suffer'd no savour of the earth to 'scape. Let its grapes the morn salute From a nocturnal root, Which feels the acrid juice Of Styx and Erebus; And turns the woe of Night, By its own craft, to a more rich delight. We buy ashes for bread; We buy diluted wine; Give me of the true, Whose ample leaves and tendrils curl'd Among the silver hills of heaven Draw everlasting dew; Wine of wine, Blood of the world, Form of forms, and mould of statures, That I intoxicated, And by the draught assimilated, May float at pleasure through all natures; The bird-language rightly spell, And that which roses say so well: Wine that is shed Like the torrents of the sun Up the horizon walls, Or like the Atlantic streams, which run When the South Sea calls. Water and bread, Food which needs no transmuting, Rainbow-flowering, wisdom-fruiting, Wine which is already man, Food which teach and reason can. Wine which Music is,-- Music and wine are one,-- That I, drinking this, Shall hear far Chaos talk with me; Kings unborn shall walk with me; And the poor grass shall plot and plan What it will do when it is man. Quicken'd so, will I unlock Every crypt of every rock. I thank the joyful juice For all I know; Winds of remembering Of the ancient being blow, And seeming-solid walls of use Open and flow. Pour, Bacchus! the remembering wine; Retrieve the loss of me and mine! Vine for vine be antidote, And the grape requite the lote! Haste to cure the old despair; Reason in Nature's lotus drench'd-- The memory of ages quench'd-- Give them again to shine; Let wine repair what this undid; And where the infection slid, A dazzling memory revive; Refresh the faded tints, Recut the aged prints, And write my old adventures with the pen Which on the first day drew, Upon the tablets blue, The dancing Pleiads and eternal men.                                                 A ruddy drop of manly bloodThe surging sea outweighs,The world uncertain comes and goes;The lover rooted stays.I fancied he was fled,-And, after many a year,Glowed unexhausted kindliness,Like daily sunrise there.My careful heart was free again,O friend, my bosom said,Through thee alone the sky is arched,Through thee the rose is red;All things through thee take nobler form,And look beyond the earth,The mill-round of our fate appearsA sun-path in thy worth.Me too thy nobleness had taughtTo master my despair;The fountains of my hidden lifeAre through thy friendship fair.                                                 Why should I keep holiday,When other men have none?Why but because when these are gay,I sit and mourn alone.And why when mirth unseals all tonguesShould mine alone be dumb?Ah! late I spoke to silent throngs,And now their hour is come.                                                 I.Winters knowEasily to shed the snow,And the untaught Spring is wiseIn cowslips and anemones.Nature, hating art and pains,Baulks and baffles plotting brains;Casualty and SurpriseAre the apples of her eyes;But she dearly loves the poor,And, by marvel of her own,Strikes the loud pretender down.For Nature listens in the rose,And hearkens in the berry's bell,To help her friends, to plague her foes,And like wise God she judges well.Yet doth much her love excelTo the souls that never fell,To swains that live in happiness,And do well because they please,Who walk in ways that are unfamed,And feats achieve before they're named.II.She is gamesome and good,But of mutable mood,--No dreary repeater now and again,She will be all things to all men.She who is old, but nowise feeble,Pours her power into the people,Merry and manifold without bar,Makes and moulds them what they are,And what they call their city wayIs not their way, but hers,And what they say they made to-day,They learned of the oaks and firs.She spawneth men as mallows fresh,Hero and maiden, flesh of her flesh;She drugs her water and her wheatWith the flavours she finds meet,And gives them what to drink and eat;And having thus their bread and growth,They do her bidding, nothing loath.What's most theirs is not their own,But borrowed in atoms from iron and stone,And in their vaunted works of ArtThe master-stroke is still her part.                                                 If I could put my woods in song And tell what's there enjoyed, All men would to my gardens throng, And leave the cities void. In my plot no tulips blow,-- Snow-loving pines and oaks instead; And rank the savage maples grow From Spring's faint flush to Autumn red. My garden is a forest ledge Which older forests bound; The banks slope down to the blue lake-edge, Then plunge to depths profound. Here once the Deluge ploughed, Laid the terraces, one by one; Ebbing later whence it flowed, They bleach and dry in the sun. The sowers made haste to depart,-- The wind and the birds which sowed it; Not for fame, nor by rules of art, Planted these, and tempests flowed it. Waters that wash my garden-side Play not in Nature's lawful web, They heed not moon or solar tide,-- Five years elapse from flood to ebb. Hither hasted, in old time, Jove, And every god,--none did refuse; And be sure at last came Love, And after Love, the Muse. Keen ears can catch a syllable, As if one spake to another, In the hemlocks tall, untamable, And what the whispering grasses smother. Æolian harps in the pine Ring with the song of the Fates; Infant Bacchus in the vine,-- Far distant yet his chorus waits. Canst thou copy in verse one chime Of the wood-bell's peal and cry, Write in a book the morning's prime, Or match with words that tender sky? Wonderful verse of the gods, Of one import, of varied tone; They chant the bliss of their abodes To man imprisoned in his own. Ever the words of the gods resound; But the porches of man's ear Seldom in this low life's round Are unsealed, that he may hear. Wandering voices in the air And murmurs in the wold Speak what I cannot declare, Yet cannot all withhold. When the shadow fell on the lake, The whirlwind in ripples wrote Air-bells of fortune that shine and break, And omens above thought. But the meanings cleave to the lake, Cannot be carried in book or urn; Go thy ways now, come later back, On waves and hedges still they burn. These the fates of men forecast, Of better men than live to-day; If who can read them comes at last He will spell in the sculpture,'Stay.'                                                 The debt is paid,The verdict said,The Furies laid,The plague is stayed,All fortunes made;Turn the key and bolt the door,Sweet is death forevermore.Nor haughty hope, nor swart chagrin,Nor murdering hate, can enter in.All is now secure and fast;Not the gods can shake the Past;Flies-to the adamantine doorBolted down forevermore.None can reenter there, -No thief so politic,No Satan with a royal trickSteal in by window, chink or hole,To bind or unbind, add what lackedInsert a leaf, or forge a name,New-face or finish what is packed,Alter or mend eternal Fact.                                                 Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,Seems nowhere to alight: the whited airHides hill and woods, the river, and the heaven,And veils the farmhouse at the garden's end.The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feetDelated, all friends shut out, the housemates sitAround the radiant fireplace, enclosedIn a tumultuous privacy of storm.Come see the north wind's masonry.Out of an unseen quarry evermoreFurnished with tile, the fierce artificerCurves his white bastions with projected roofRound every windward stake, or tree, or door.Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild workSo fanciful, so savage, nought cares heFor number or proportion. Mockingly,On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;A swan-like form invests the hiddden thorn;Fills up the famer's lane from wall to wall,Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gateA tapering turret overtops the work.And when his hours are numbered, and the worldIs all his own, retiring, as he were not,Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished ArtTo mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,The frolic architecture of the snow.                                                 Virtue runs before the museAnd defies her skill,She is rapt, and doth refuseTo wait a painter's will.Star-adoring, occupied,Virtue cannot bend her,Just to please a poet's pride,To parade her splendor.The bard must be with good intentNo more his, but hers,Throw away his pen and paint,Kneel with worshippers.Then, perchance, a sunny rayFrom the heaven of fire,His lost tools may over-pay,And better his desire.                                                 Himself it was who wroteHis rank, and quartered his own coat.There is no king nor sovereign stateThat can fix a hero's rate;Each to all is venerable,Cap-a-pie invulnerable,Until he write, where all eyes rest,Slave or master on his breast.I saw men go up and downIn the country and the town,With this prayer upon their neck,"Judgment and a judge we seek."Not to monarchs they repair,Nor to learned jurist's chair,But they hurry to their peers,To their kinsfolk and their dears,Louder than with speech they pray,What am I? companion; say.And the friend not hesitatesTo assign just place and mates,Answers not in word or letter,Yet is understood the better;—Is to his friend a looking-glass,Reflects his figure that doth pass.Every wayfarer he meetsWhat himself declared, repeats;What himself confessed, records;Sentences him in his words,The form is his own corporal form,And his thought the penal worm.Yet shine for ever virgin minds,Loved by stars and purest winds,Which, o'er passion throned sedate,Have not hazarded their state,Disconcert the searching spy,Rendering to a curious eyeThe durance of a granite ledgeTo those who gaze from the sea's edge.It is there for benefit,It is there for purging light,There for purifying storms,And its depths reflect all forms;It cannot parley with the mean,Pure by impure is not seen.For there's no sequestered grot,Lone mountain tam, or isle forgot,But justice journeying in the sphereDaily stoops to harbor there.                                                 Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloaked clown,Of thee, from the hill-top looking down;And the heifer, that lows in the upland farm,Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm;The sexton tolling the bell at noon,Dreams not that great NapoleonStops his horse, and lists with delight,Whilst his files sweep round yon Alpine height;Nor knowest thou what argumentThy life to thy neighbor's creed has lent:All are needed by each one,Nothing is fair or good alone.I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,Singing at dawn on the alder bough;I brought him home in his nest at even;—He sings the song, but it pleases not now;For I did not bring home the river and sky;He sang to my ear; they sang to my eye.The delicate shells lay on the shore;The bubbles of the latest waveFresh pearls to their enamel gave;And the bellowing of the savage seaGreeted their safe escape to me;I wiped away the weeds and foam,And fetched my sea-born treasures home;But the poor, unsightly, noisome thingsHad left their beauty on the shoreWith the sun, and the sand, and the wild uproar.The lover watched his graceful maidAs 'mid the virgin train she strayed,Nor knew her beauty's best attireWas woven still by the snow-white quire;At last she came to his hermitage,Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage,—The gay enchantment was undone,A gentle wife, but fairy none.Then I said, "I covet Truth;Beauty is unripe childhood's cheat,—I leave it behind with the games of youth."As I spoke, beneath my feetThe ground-pine curled its pretty wreath,Running over the club-moss burrs;I inhaled the violet's breath;Around me stood the oaks and firs;Pine cones and acorns lay on the ground;Above me soared the eternal sky,Full of light and deity;Again I saw, again I heard,The rolling river, the morning bird;—Beauty through my senses stole,I yielded myself to the perfect whole.                                                 Give to barrows, trays, and pansGrace and glimmer of romance;Bring the moonlight into noonHid in gleaming piles of stone;On the city's paved streetPlant gardens lined with lilacs sweet;Let spouting fountains cool the air,Singing in the sun-baked square;Let statue, picture, park, and hall,Ballad, flag, and festival,The past restore, the day adorn,And make to-morrow a new morn.So shall the drudge in dusty frockSpy behind the city clockRetinues of airy kings,Skirts of angels, starry wings,His fathers shining in bright fables,His children fed at heavenly tables.'T is the privilege of ArtThus to play its cheerful part,Man on earth to acclimate,And bend the exile to his fate,And, moulded of one elementWith the days and firmament,Teach him on these as stairs to climb,And live on even terms with Time;Whilst upper life the slender rillOf human sense doth overfill.                                                 Who gave thee, O Beauty!The keys of this breast,Too credulous loverOf blest and unblest?Say when in lapsed agesThee knew I of old;Or what was the serviceFor which I was sold?When first my eyes saw thee,I found me thy thrall,By magical drawings,Sweet tyrant of all!I drank at thy fountainFalse waters of thirst;Thou intimate stranger,Thou latest and first!Thy dangerous glancesMake women of men;New-born we are meltingInto nature again.Lavish, lavish promiser,Nigh persuading gods to err,Guest of million painted formsWhich in turn thy glory warms,The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc,The swinging spider's silver line,The ruby of the drop of wine,The shining pebble of the pond,Thou inscribest with a bondIn thy momentary playWould bankrupt Nature to repay.Ah! what avails itTo hide or to shunWhom the Infinite OneHath granted his throne?The heaven high overIs the deep's lover,The sun and seaInformed by thee,Before me run,And draw me on,Yet fly me still,As Fate refusesTo me the heart Fate for me chooses,Is it that my opulent soulWas mingled from the generous whole,Sea valleys and the deep of skiesFurnished several supplies,And the sands whereof I'm madeDraw me to them self-betrayed?I turn the proud portfoliosWhich hold the grand designsOf Salvator, of Guercino,And Piranesi's lines.I hear the lofty PæansOf the masters of the shell,Who heard the starry music,And recount the numbers well:Olympian bards who sungDivine Ideas below,Which always find us young,And always keep us so.Oft in streets or humblest placesI detect far wandered graces,Which from Eden wide astrayIn lowly homes have lost their way.Thee gliding through the sea of form,Like the lightning through the storm,Somewhat not to be possessed,Somewhat not to be caressed,No feet so fleet could ever find,No perfect form could ever bind.Thou eternal fugitiveHovering over all that live,Quick and skilful to inspireSweet extravagant desire,Starry space and lily bellFilling with thy roseate smell,Wilt not give the lips to tasteOf the nectar which thou hast.All that's good and great with theeStands in deep conspiracy.Thou hast bribed the dark and lonelyTo report thy features only,And the cold and purple morningItself with thoughts of thee adorning,The leafy dell, the city mart,Equal trophies of thine art,E'en the flowing azure airThou hast touched for my despair,And if I languish into dreams,Again I meet the ardent beams.Queen of things! I dare not dieIn Being's deeps past ear and eye,Lest there I find the same deceiver,And be the sport of Fate forever.Dread power, but dear! if God thou be,Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me.                                                 The sun set, but set not his hope:Stars rose; his faith was earlier up:Fixed on the enormous galaxy,Deeper and older seemed his eye;And matched his sufferance sublimeThe taciturnity of time.He spoke, and words more soft than rainBrought the Age of Gold again:His action won such reverence sweetAs hid all measure of the feat.                                                 How much, preventing God! how much I oweTo the defenses thou hast round me set:Example, custom, fear, occasional slow,These scorned bondmen were my parapet.I dare not peep over this parapetTo gauge with glance the roaring gulf beelow,The depths of sin to which I had descended,Had not these me against myself defended.                                                 Was never form and never faceSo sweet to SEYD as only graceWhich did not slumber like a stone,But hovered gleaming and was gone.Beauty chased he everywhere,In flame, in storm, in clouds of air.He smote the lake to feed his eyeWith the beryl beam of the broken wave;He flung in pebbles well to hearThe moment's music which they gave.Oft pealed for him a lofty toneFrom nodding pole and belting zone.He heard a voice none else could hearFrom centred and from errant sphere.The quaking earth did quake in rhyme,Seas ebbed and flowed in epic chime.In dens of passion, and pits of woe,He saw strong Eros struggling through,To sun the dark and solve the curse,And beam to the bounds of the universe.While thus to love he gave his daysIn loyal worship, scorning praise,How spread their lures for him in vainThieving Ambition and paltering Gain!He thought it happier to be dead,To die for Beauty, than live for bread.                                                 The sense of the world is short, -Long and various the report, -To love and be beloved;Men and gods have not outlearned it;And, how oft soe'er they've turned it,'Tis not to be improved.                                                 Can rules or tutors educateThe semigod whom we await?He must be musical,Tremulous, impressional,Alive to gentle influenceOf landscape and of sky,And tender to the spirit-touchOf man's or maiden's eye:But, to his native centre fast,Shall into Future fuse the Past,And the world's flowing fates in his own mould recast.                                                 If the red slayer think he slays,Or if the slain think he is slain,They know not well the subtle waysI keep, and pass, and turn again.Far or forgot to me is near;Shadow and sunlight are the same;The vanished gods to me appear;And one to me are shame and fame.They reckon ill who leave me out;When me they fly, I am the wings;I am the doubter and the doubt,And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.The strong gods pine for my abode,And pine in vain the sacred Seven;But thou, meek lover of the good!Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.                                                 Man was made of social earth,Child and brother from his birth;Tethered by a liquid cordOf blood through veins of kindred poured,Next his heart the fireside bandOf mother, father, sister, stand;Names from awful childhood heard,Throbs of a wild religion stirred,Their good was heaven, their harm was vice,Till Beauty came to snap all ties,The maid, abolishing the past,With lotus-wine obliteratesDear memory's stone-incarved traits,And by herself supplants aloneFriends year by year more inly known.When her calm eyes opened bright,All were foreign in their light.It was ever the self-same tale,The old experience will not fail,—Only two in the garden walked,And with snake and seraph talked.But God said;I will have a purer gift,There is smoke in the flame;New flowerets bring, new prayers uplift,And love without a name.Fond children, ye desireTo please each other well;Another round, a higher,Ye shall climb on the heavenly stair,And selfish preference forbear;And in right deserving,And without a swervingEach from your proper state,Weave roses for your mate.Deep, deep are loving eyes,Flowed with naphtha fiery sweet,And the point is ParadiseWhere their glances meet:Their reach shall yet be more profound,And a vision without bound:The axis of those eyes sun-clearBe the axis of the sphere;Then shall the lights ye pour amainGo without check or intervals,Through from the empyrean walls,Unto the same again.Close, close to men,Like undulating layer of air,Right above their heads,The potent plain of Dæmons spreads.Stands to each human soul its own,For watch, and ward, and furtheranceIn the snares of nature's dance;And the lustre and the graceWhich fascinate each human heart,Beaming from another part,Translucent through the mortal covers,Is the Dæmon's form and face.To and fro the Genius hies,A gleam which plays and hoversOver the maiden's head,And dips sometimes as low as to her eyes.Unknown, — albeit lying near, —To men the path to the Dæmon sphere,And they that swiftly come and go,Leave no track on the heavenly snow.Sometimes the airy synod bends,And the mighty choir descends,And the brains of men thenceforth,In crowded and in still resorts,Teem with unwonted thoughts.As when a shower of meteorsCross the orbit of the earth,And, lit by fringent air,Blaze near and far.Mortals deem the planets brightHave slipped their sacred bars,And the lone seaman all the nightSails astonished amid stars.Beauty of a richer vein,Graces of a subtler strain,Unto men these moon-men lend,And our shrinking sky extend.So is man's narrow pathBy strength and terror skirted,Also (from the song the wrathOf the Genii be averted!The Muse the truth uncolored speaking),The Dæmons are self-seeking;Their fierce and limitary willDraws men to their likeness still.The erring painter made Love blind,Highest Love who shines on all;Him radiant, sharpest-sighted godNone can bewilder;Whose eyes pierceThe Universe,Path-finder, road-builder,Mediator, royal giver,Rightly-seeing, rightly-seen,Of joyful and transparent mien.'Tis a sparkle passingFrom each to each, from me to thee,Perpetually,Sharing all, daring all,Levelling, misplacingEach obstruction, it unitesEquals remote, and seeming opposites.And ever and forever LoveDelights to build a road;Unheeded Danger near him strides,Love laughs, and on a lion rides.But Cupid wears another faceBorn into Dæmons less divine,His roses bleach apace,His nectar smacks of wine.The Dæmon ever builds a wall,Himself incloses and includes,Solitude in solitudes:In like sort his love doth fall.He is an oligarch,He prizes wonder, fame, and mark,He loveth crowns,He scorneth drones;He doth electThe beautiful and fortunate,And the sons of intellect,And the souls of ample fate,Who the Future's gates unbar,Minions of the Morning Star.In his prowess he exults,And the multitude insults.His impatient looks devourOft the humble and the poor,And, seeing his eye glare,They drop their few pale flowersGathered with hope to pleaseAlong the mountain towers,Lose courage, and despair.He will never be gainsaid,Pitiless, will not be stayed.His hot tyrannyBurns up every other tie;Therefore comes an hour from JoveWhich his ruthless will defies,And the dogs of Fate unties.Shiver the palaces of glass,Shrivel the rainbow-colored wallsWhere in bright art each god and sibyl dweltSecure as in the Zodiack's belt;And the galleries and hallsWherein every Siren sung,Like a meteor pass.For this fortune wanted rootIn the core of God's abysm,Was a weed of self and schism:And ever the Dæmonic LoveIs the ancestor of wars,And the parent of remorse.                                                 Think me not unkind and rude That I walk alone in grove and glen; I go to the god of the wood To fetch his word to men.Tax not my sloth that I Fold my arms beside the brook; Each cloud that floated in the sky Writes a letter in my book.Chide me not, laborious band, For the idle flowers I brought; Every aster in my hand Goes home loaded with a thought.There was never mystery But 'tis figured in the flowers; Was never secret history But birds tell it in the bowers.One harvest from thy field Homeward brought the oxen strong; A second crop thine acres yield, Which I gather in a song.                                                 Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home; Thou art my friend, and I'm not thine. Long through thy weary crowds I roam; A river-ark on the ocean brine, Long I've been tossed like the driven foam; But now, proud world! I'm going home. Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face; To Grandeur with his wise grimace; To upstart Wealth's averted eye; To supple Office, low and high; To crowded halls, to court and street; To frozen hearts and hasting feet; To those who go, and those who come; Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home. I am going to my own hearth-stone, Bosomed to yon green hills alone,-- A secret nook in a pleasant land, Whose groves the frolic fairies planned; Where arches green, the livelong day, Echo the blackbird's roundelay, And vulgar feet have never trod A spot that is sacred to thought and God. O, when I am safe in my sylvan home, I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome; And when I am stretched beneath the pines, Where the evening star so holy shines, I laugh at the lore and the pride of man, At the sophist schools and the learned clan; For what are they all, in their high conceit, When man in the bush with God may meet?                                                 Higher far,Upward, into the pure realm,Over sun or star,Over the flickering Dæmon film,Thou must mount for love,—Into vision which all formIn one only form dissolves;In a region where the wheel,On which all beings ride,Visibly revolves;Where the starred eternal wormGirds the world with bound and term;Where unlike things are like,When good and ill,And joy and moan,Melt into one.There Past, Present, Future, shootTriple blossoms from one rootSubstances at base dividedIn their summits are united,There the holy Essence rolls,One through separated souls,And the sunny &Aelig;on sleepsFolding nature in its deeps,And every fair and every goodKnown in part or known impureTo men below,In their archetypes endure.The race of gods,Or those we erring own,Are shadows flitting up and downIn the still abodes.The circles of that sea are laws,Which publish and which hide the Cause.Pray for a beamOut of that sphereThee to guide and to redeem.O what a loadOf care and toilBy lying Use bestowed,From his shoulders falls, who seesThe true astronomy,The period of peace!Counsel which the ages kept,Shall the well-born soul accept.As the overhanging treesFill the lake with images,As garment draws the garment's hemMen their fortunes bring with them;By right or wrong,Lands and goods go to the strong;Property will brutely drawStill to the proprietor,Silver to silver creep and wind,And kind to kind,Nor less the eternal polesOf tendency distribute souls.There need no vows to bindWhom not each other seek but find.They give and take no pledge or oath,Nature is the bond of both.No prayer persuades, no flattery fawns,Their noble meanings are their pawns.Plain and cold is their address,Power have they for tenderness,And so thoroughly is knownEach others' purpose by his own,They can parley without meeting,Need is none of forms of greeting,They can well communicateIn their innermost estate;When each the other shall avoid,Shall each by each be most enjoyed.Not with scarfs or perfumed glovesDo these celebrate their loves,Not by jewels, feasts, and savors,Not by ribbons or by favors,But by the sun-spark on the sea,And the cloud-shadow on the lea,The soothing lapse of morn to mirk,And the cheerful round of work.Their cords of love so public are,They intertwine the farthest star.The throbbing sea, the quaking earth,Yield sympathy and signs of mirth;Is none so high, so mean is none,But feels and seals this union.Even the tell Furies are appeased,The good applaud, the lost are eased.Love's hearts are faithful, but not fond,Bound for the just, but not beyond;Not glad, as the low-loving herd,Of self in others still preferred,But they have heartily designedThe benefit of broad mankind.And they serve men austerely,After their own genius, clearly,Without a false humility;For this is love's nobility,Not to scatter bread and gold,Goods and raiment bought and sold,But to hold fast his simple sense,And speak the speech of innocence,And with hand, and body, and blood,To make his bosom-counsel good:For he that feeds men, serveth few,He serves all, who dares be true.                                                 By the rude bridge that arched the flood,Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,Here once the embattled farmers stoodAnd fired the shot heard round the world.The foe long since in silence slept;Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has sweptDown the dark stream which seaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set today a votive stone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are gone. Spirit, that made those heroes dareTo die, and leave their children free, Bid Time and Nature gently spareThe shaft we raise to them and thee.                                                 The mountain and the squirrel Had a quarrel; And the former called the latter "Little Prig." Bun replied, "You are doubtless very big; But all sorts of things and weather Must be taken in together To make up a year And a sphere. And I think it's no disgrace To occupy my place. If I'm not so large as you, You are not so small as I, And not half so spry. I'll not deny you make A very pretty squirrel track; Talents differ: all is well and wisely put; If I cannot carry forests on my back, Neither can you crack a nut."                                                 Mine are the night and morning,The pits of air, the gulf of space,The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,The innumerable days.I hid in the solar glory,I am dumb in the pealing song,I rest on the pitch of the torrent,In slumber I am strong.No numbers have counted my tallies,No tribes my house can fill,I sit by the shining Fount of Life,And pour the deluge still;And ever by delicate powersGathering along the centuriesFrom race on race the rarest flowers,My wreath shall nothing miss.And many a thousand summersMy apples ripened well,And light from meliorating starsWith firmer glory fell.I wrote the past in charactersOf rock and fire the scroll,The building in the coral sea,The planting of the coal.And thefts from satellites and ringsAnd broken stars I drew,And out of spent and aged thingsI formed the world anew;What time the gods kept carnival,Tricked out in star and flower,And in cramp elf and saurian formsThey swathed their too much power.Time and Thought were my surveyors,They laid their courses well,They boiled the sea, and baked the layersOr granite, marl, and shell.But he, the man-child glorious,--Where tarries he the while?The rainbow shines his harbinger,The sunset gleams his smile.My boreal lights leap upward,Forthright my planets roll,And still the man-child is not born,The summit of the whole.Must time and tide forever run?Will never my winds go sleep in the west?Will never my wheels which whirl the sunAnd satellites have rest?Too much of donning and doffing,Too slow the rainbow fades,I weary of my robe of snow,My leaves and my cascades;I tire of globes and races,Too long the game is played;What without him is summer's pomp,Or winter's frozen shade?I travail in pain for him,My creatures travail and wait;His couriers come by squadrons,He comes not to the gate.Twice I have moulded an image,And thrice outstretched my hand,Made one of day, and one of night,And one of the salt sea-sand.One in a Judaean manger,And one by Avon stream,One over against the mouths of Nile,And one in the Academe.I moulded kings and saviours,And bards o'er kings to rule;--But fell the starry influence short,The cup was never full.Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,And mix the bowl again;Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.Let war and trade and creeds and songBlend, ripen race on race,The sunburnt world a man shall breedOf all the zones, and countless days.No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,My oldest force is good as new,And the fresh rose on yonder thornGives back the bending heavens in dew.                                                 Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,And marching single in an endless file,Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.To each they offer gifts after his will,Bread, kingdom, stars, and sky that holds them all.I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,Forgot my morning wishes, hastilyTook a few herbs and apples, and the DayTurned and departed silent. I, too late,Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.                                                 Knows he who tills this lonely fieldTo reap its scanty corn,What mystic fruit his acres yieldAt midnight and at morn?In the long sunny afternoon,The plain was full of ghosts,I wandered up, I wandered down,Beset by pensive hosts.The winding Concord gleamed below,Pouring as wide a floodAs when my brothers long ago,Came with me to the wood.But they are gone,— the holy ones,Who trod with me this lonely vale,The strong, star-bright companionsAre silent, low, and pale.My good, my noble, in their prime,Who made this world the feast it was,Who learned with me the lore of time,Who loved this dwelling-place.They took this valley for their toy,They played with it in every mood,A cell for prayer, a hall for joy,They treated nature as they would.They colored the horizon round,Stars flamed and faded as they bade,All echoes hearkened for their sound,They made the woodlands glad or mad.I touch this flower of silken leafWhich once our childhood knewIts soft leaves wound me with a griefWhose balsam never grew.Hearken to yon pine warblerSinging aloft in the tree;Hearest thou, O traveller!What he singeth to me? Not unless God made sharp thine earWith sorrow such as mine,Out of that delicate lay couldst thouThe heavy dirge divine.Go, lonely man, it saith,They loved thee from their birth,Their hands were pure, and pure their faith,There are no such hearts on earth.Ye drew one mother's milk,One chamber held ye all;A very tender historyDid in your childhood fall.Ye cannot unlock your heart,The key is gone with them;The silent organ loudest chantsThe master's requiem.                                                 I love thy music, mellow bell,I love thine iron chime,To life or death, to heaven or hell,Which calls the sons of Time.Thy voice upon the deepThe home-bound sea-boy hails,It charms his cares to sleep,It cheers him as he sails.To house of God and heavenly joysThy summons called our sires,And good men thought thy sacred voiceDisarmed the thunder's fires.And soon thy music, sad death-bell,Shall lift its notes once more,And mix my requiem with the windThat sweeps my native shore.                                                 Give all to love;Obey thy heart;Friends, kindred, days,Estate, good-fame,Plans, credit, and the Muse,-Nothing refuse.'Tis a brave master;Let it have scope:Follow it utterly,Hope beyond hope:High and more highIt dives into noon,With wing unspent,Untold intent;But it is a god,Knows its own path,And the outlets of the sky.It was not for the mean;It requireth courage stout,Souls above doubt,Valor unbending;It will reward,-They shall returnMore than they were,And ever ascending.Leave all for love;Yet, hear me, yet,One word more thy heart behoved,One pulse more of firm endeavor,-Keep thee today,To-morrow, forever,Free as an ArabOf thy beloved.Cling with life to the maid;But when the surprise,First vague shadow of surmiseFlits across her bosom youngOf a joy apart from thee,Free be she, fancy-free;Nor thou detain her vesture's hem,Nor the palest rose she flungFrom her summer diadem.                                                 Deep in the man sits fast his fate To mould his fortunes, mean or great: Unknown to Cromwell as to me Was Cromwell's measure or degree; Unknown to him as to his horse, If he than his groom be better or worse. He works, plots, fights, in rude affairs, With squires, lords, kings, his craft compares, Till late he learned, through doubt and fear, Broad England harbored not his peer: Obeying time, the last to own The Genius from its cloudy throne. For the prevision is allied Unto the thing so signified; Or say, the foresight that awaits Is the same Genius that creates.
